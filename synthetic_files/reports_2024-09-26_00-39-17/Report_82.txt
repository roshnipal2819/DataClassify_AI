# Lab Report: Analysis of Various Mixtures



**Report ID:** Report_82



## Introduction



This report presents the detailed analysis of various oil and wax mixtures using advanced analytical instruments. The study focuses on determining various properties such as absorbance, viscosity, conductivity, and chemical composition. Each mixture of ingredients was treated as a distinct test sample to ensure accurate results.



### Table 1: Spectroscopic Analysis



Instrument | Sample | Wavelength/NM | Absorbance/Intensity

---|---|---|---

Spectrometer Alpha-300 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | 950 nm | -  

FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | 780 1/cm | -  

UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600 | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | - | 1.2 Abs  



(Note: Absorbance values may appear insignificant due to calibration discrepancies; refer to supplemental materials.)



### Detailed Observations



Upon evaluating the results from the **Spectrometer Alpha-300**, the absorbance characteristic specifically at 950 nm indicated an increased energy absorption level characterized by the blend of Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E. This observation is pivotal in understanding the mixture's interaction with infrared light.



Concurrently, the **FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400** measurements at 780 cm^-1 for the same sample (Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E) further corroborate the energy absorption findings, despite an unexpected anomaly leading to zero-valued data in the absence of Vitamin E's characteristic peak.



### Table 2: Chromatographic and Conductivity Analysis



Instrument | Sample | Measure | Unit

---|---|---|---

Ion Chromatograph IC-2100 | Coconut Oil, Glycerin | 0.025 | mM  

Gas Chromatograph GC-2010 | Coconut Oil, Gum | 200 | ppm  

Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 | Almond Oil | 45 | ug/mL  

Conductivity Meter CM-215 | Almond Oil | 1500 | uS/cm  



### Results and Interpretation



The **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100** reveals the presence of Coconut Oil and Glycerin at a concentration of 0.025 mM, underscoring their synergy and potential ion-exchange activity. Such molecular data may seem extraneous within isolated contexts yet prove critical during systematic correlation.



Through careful assessment using the **Gas Chromatograph GC-2010**, the quantification of volatile constituents within the Coconut Oil and Gum matrix resulted in a 200 ppm profile, which intriguingly aligns with thresholds reported in prior studies. Moreover, potential cross-sensitivity merits further discourse.



### Table 3: Physico-Chemical Characteristics



Instrument | Sample | Viscosity / Speed | Unit

---|---|---|---

Viscometer VS-300 | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 5090.94 | cP  

Viscometer VS-300 | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 2930.82 | cP  

Viscometer VS-300 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax | 5030.41 | cP  

Centrifuge X100 | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 12000 | RPM  

Thermocycler TC-5000 | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 72 | Â°C  



### Discussion



The dynamic viscosity measurements are compelling, showcasing a remarkable variance between Coconut Oil mixtures. Specifically, the **Viscometer VS-300** assessed two distinct formulations:

- The admixture of Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin exhibited a higher viscosity (5090.94 cP) compared to its lesser complex counterpart, which reported at 5030.41 cP with Beeswax inclusion instead.

- Comparatively, Jojoba Oil composites demonstrated significantly lower viscosity dynamics, a salient feature accentuated in yield index correlations.



### Conclusion



These findings underscore the intricate interactions at play among different oil and chemical mixtures. Each spectroscopic, chromatographic, and physico-chemical assessment contributes to a multi-dimensional understanding of sample properties. Future work may focus on deeper molecular interactions through refined calibration, independent variable isolation, and enhanced sample stability studies.
