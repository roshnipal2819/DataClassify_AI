# Laboratory Report 285



**Title:** Multi-Instrument Analysis of Oil-Based Mixtures



**Date:** [Insert Date]



**Introduction:**



The following report outlines a series of experiments conducted on various oil-based mixtures using a variety of analytical instruments. Each mixture consists of specific combinations of Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Beeswax, Glycerin, Vitamin E, and Gum. The objective was to assess diverse properties like optical density, friction, spectral absorption, centrifugal force, conductivity, acidity, temperature response, molecular weight, and viscosity to determine the interactions and characteristics of these mixtures.

## Observations and Measurements



### Table 1: Optical Density and Friction Measurements



| Sample Composition                       | Instrument                  | Measured Value | Unit  |

|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-------|

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin      | Microplate Reader MRX       | 3.2            | OD    |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax                      | Microplate Reader MRX       | 2.6            | OD    |

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol                | Four Ball FB-1000           | 0.750          | mm    |

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol                | Four Ball FB-1000           | 0.670          | mm    |



*Note: The results from the Four Ball FB-1000 indicate enhanced lubrication properties of mixtures involving Cetyl Alcohol, which could be further explored in industrial applications.*



### Table 2: Spectral and Centrifugal Analysis



| Sample Composition              | Instrument                 | Measured Value | Unit |

|---------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|------|

| Coconut Oil, Beeswax            | Spectrometer Alpha-300     | 850            | nm   |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  | Centrifuge X100            | 14200          | RPM  |



*The Spectrometer Alpha-300 results suggest a strong absorption peak, whereas the high RPM from the Centrifuge X100 demonstrates the stability of Jojoba Oil-based emulsions under high rotational forces.*



### Table 3: Conductivity, Acidity, and Temperature Analysis



| Sample Composition   | Instrument               | Measured Value   | Unit      |

|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------|

| Coconut Oil, Glycerin| Conductivity Meter CM-215| 1500             | uS/cm     |

| Coconut Oil          | Titrator T-905           | 5.5              | M         |

| Coconut Oil, Gum, Glycerin | Thermocycler TC-5000      | 37               | Â°C        |



*The Thermocycler TC-5000 data corroborates the thermal responsiveness of the samples, notably in temperature-sensitive applications.*



### Table 4: Molecular Weight and Viscosity Analysis



| Sample Composition                       | Instrument                  | Measured Value | Unit  |

|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-------|

| Almond Oil, Glycerin                     | Mass Spectrometer MS-20     | 1200           | m/z   |

| Jojoba Oil                               | Viscometer VS-300           | 2533.3         | cP    |

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol                | Viscometer VS-300           | 7275.11        | cP    |

| Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin            | Viscometer VS-300           | 7316.37        | cP    |



*The Viscometer VS-300 results indicate significant variances in viscosity among samples, with Almond Oil mixtures exhibiting high resistance to flow.*

## Random Information Section



### Observational Notes:

- Ensure adequate mixing of each component to prevent phase separation prior to testing.

- Instrument calibration was cross-referenced with standard benchmarks for validation.



### Miscellaneous Annotations:

- The results might suggest biophysical trends pertinent to formulation chemistry. However, a deeper investigation is warranted. 

- One should note that the use of the alpha-phase spectrometer was chosen to explore its spectral purity capabilities which remain unexplained in broader contexts.



### Dissociated Data Snippets:

- Mixtures showing low OD values were speculated to have less optical transparency, which might impede light-based applications.

- Random pH adjustments might not impact certain oil blends as initially theorized.

## Conclusion



Each mixture revealed distinct and measurable characteristics, delivering comprehensive insights into their potential applications. While the random scattering of data proved challenging to interpret cohesively, thematic elements emerged regarding lubrication, spectroscopic absorption, and viscosity differences. Future investigations should refine these findings and address the thermochemical interactions at a molecular level.
