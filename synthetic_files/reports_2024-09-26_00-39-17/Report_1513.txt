## Discussion



The analysis of Mixture A using the Conductivity Meter CM-215 revealed a high conductivity, indicative of ionic presence or polar compound interactions. Mixture B demonstrated a moderate thermal stability at 37°C, suitable for applications sensitive to temperature fluctuations.



The UV-Vis spectrophotometry of Mixture D showed an absorbance at 2.5 Abs, which suggests potential for UV protective formulations. The viscosity readings for Mixtures C and F were notably different, reflecting the impact of ingredients like Cetyl Alcohol and Beeswax on texture.



Irrelevant Detail: During the test, the ambient temperature was recorded at 22°C, which is optimal for most laboratory analyses.

## Conclusion



This comprehensive examination illustrates the diverse properties of cosmetic mixtures. The data obtained provides a foundation for developing new formulations with tailored characteristics suitable for specific applications. Further investigation is advised to expand on these initial findings, especially considering environmental effects and ingredient proportions.
