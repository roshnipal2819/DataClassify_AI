**Results and Discussion**



The analytical procedures revealed intricate data. For Almond Oil in combination with Beeswax, the HPLC system managed a precise quantification at 872 mg/L, indicative of complex molecular interactions potentially forming persistent emulsions. The thermocycler results at 45°C aligned with thermal stability protocols, though such readings are notably variable.



In the testing of Coconut Oil with Gum and Beeswax via centrifuge and ion chromatography, a notable separation occurred at 12,000 RPM, exposing different phases with an ionic presence marked at 85 mM. These may suggest potential applications in energy storage due to the ionic nature and separation efficiency.



Rheological assessments using the Rheometer showed the viscosity of the Coconut Oil mixture to stay consistent (321 Pa-s), hinting at useful properties in thickening agents. Similarly, the wear test on Almond Oil and Gum mixtures provided insights into reliability under mechanical stresses.



Moreover, the spectroscopic analysis conducted with both FTIR and simple spectrometers revealed significant details about molecular bonds and light absorption characteristics. The spectrometric absorption at 1600 1/cm consolidated the presence of strong molecular vibrations. The 700 nm absorption highlight is crucial for understanding light-absorbing materials, which is central to optical applications.



Overall, these sophisticated instruments afforded valuable insights into the physical and chemical profiles of these multi-component mixtures, each instrumental system pinpointing a unique characteristic vital for potential industrial applications.
