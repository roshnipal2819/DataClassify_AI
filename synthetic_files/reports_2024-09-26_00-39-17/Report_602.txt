## Observations and Results



### Centrifugation Analysis

The **Centrifuge X100** was employed to assess the sedimentation rate of **Sample A**.



| Sample | Test Conducted | Oil Type     | Additives  | Observed Sedimentation Rate |

|--------|----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------------------|

| A      | Centrifugation | Coconut Oil  | Glycerin   | 13,450 RPM                 |



It was observed that the high rotation speed efficiently separated the components, indicating a well-integrated mixture stability at elevated RPMs.



### Wear and Friction Test

Using the **Four Ball Tester FB-1000**, **Sample B** was examined for wear resistance.



| Sample | Lubricant   | Oil Type    | Additive  | Wear Scar Diameter   |

|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|

| B      | Wear Test   | Coconut Oil | Vitamin E | 0.875 mm             |



This small wear scar indicates high lubricity and reduced abrasive wear, showcasing the efficacy of vitamin E as a performance enhancer.



### X-Ray Diffraction

The **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000** provided crystallographic data for **Sample C**.



| Sample | Instrument    | Oil Type   | Additives       | Crystalline Structure Observation |

|--------|---------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|

| C      | Diffractometer| Jojoba Oil | Gum, Vitamin E  | 56°C                             |



Diffraction patterns suggested a melting phase around 56°C, aligning with common crystalline transformation temperatures for similar compositions.



### PCR Analysis

The **PCR Machine PCR-96** analyzed the thermal cycling behavior of **Sample D**.



| Sample | Device     | Oil Type    | Additives     | Amplification Threshold |

|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|

| D      | PCR Test   | Almond Oil  | Gum, Glycerin | 25 Ct                   |



Chemical stability under repeated thermal cycles was affirmed, revealing these additives do not degrade at standard PCR conditions.



### Optical Density Measurement

Optical density was recorded via the **Microplate Reader MRX** for **Sample E**.



| Sample | Reader Test | Oil Type   | Additive   | Optical Density          |

|--------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------------------|

| E      | OD Measure  | Almond Oil | Vitamin E  | 3.2 OD                   |



This high optical density linked to Vitamin E concentration suggests potent absorptive properties beneficial for various applications.



### FTIR Spectroscopy

The **FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400** disclosed the spectral profile of **Sample F**.



| Sample | Spectroscopy | Oil Type     | Additive  | Absorption Band (cm⁻¹)  |

|--------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------------------|

| F      | FTIR Test    | Coconut Oil  | Glycerin  | 3500 1/cm               |



A pronounced peak at 3500 cm⁻¹ verified the presence of -OH groups, confirming effective interaction between coconut oil and glycerin.



### Viscosity Measurement

The **Viscometer VS-300** quantified the viscosity of **Sample G**.



| Sample | Viscosity Test | Oil Type    | Additives                | Viscosity    |

|--------|----------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------|

| G      | Viscometric    | Coconut Oil | Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 5054.51 cP   |



The significant increase in viscosity from the baseline suggested enhanced texture and stability through synergistic effects between the components.



## Discussion



Each examination furnished unique insights into the physical and chemical properties of the mixtures. Centrifuge data portrayed centrifugal stability, while the four-ball tester elucidated frictional properties. XRD and PCR findings illuminated thermodynamic stability. The microplate reader presented optical characteristics, FTIR Spectroscopy indicated molecular interactions, and the viscometer highlighted rheological properties.



Despite minor discrepancies, like sporadic temperature fluctuation during the thermal tests, the outcomes consistently suggest robust enhancement of fundamental attributes based on choice and concentration of additives. Further exploration could delve into longer-term stability and kinetic performance under varied environmental conditions. 



By synthesizing these diverse observations, broader applications in cosmetics, lubricants, and pharmaceuticals can be envisioned, particularly where specific structural and functional properties are desired. Although irreverent data points appeared intermittently, they were ruled out as statistical anomalies upon conclusive cross-verification.



The results offer substantial promise for leveraging these mixtures in advanced formulations catering to cutting-edge markets.
