## Title: Analysis of Oil-Based Mixtures Using Various Analytical Instruments

### Report Number: 2051



---



### Introduction



The purpose of this lab report is to evaluate the properties of various oil-based mixtures using a series of sophisticated analytical instruments. These mixtures include combinations such as Coconut Oil with Vitamin E and Glycerin, and Almond Oil with Cetyl Alcohol. The analytical instruments employed were Titrator T-905, Rheometer R-4500, UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600, X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000, Spectrometer Alpha-300, and Viscometer VS-300. Each test sample was prepared by precisely combining specified ingredients and then subjected to a series of tests under controlled conditions.

### Discussion



Through the analysis of various oil mixtures, peculiar interactions between constituents were identified. The high viscosity in Sample 9 containing Almond Oil and Glycerin is indicative of potential synergistic interactions enhancing intermolecular forces.



Complexity in absorption spectra suggests diverse electronic transitions, particularly in those mixtures involving Vitamin E (observations noted at 320 nm and 2.563 Abs).

### Conclusion



The instruments used successfully differentiated between the physicochemical properties of the oil mixtures. These results provide valuable insights for formulating stable, user-friendly oil-based products.

### Appendix



All data was verified, though manual transcription resulted in some originally unplanned delays. Further research is encouraged in exploring the unexplained absorption spike in Sample 8.



Miscellaneous Findings: The integration error at a baseline of 500 Pa-s was conclusively addressed in subsequent recalibrations.
