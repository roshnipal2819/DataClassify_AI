### Complex Data Analyses



In the course of these tests, it became apparent that the intricate interactions between constituents, such as the influence of Vitamin E on solution color density, are profound. Observations using the UV-Vis Spectrophotometer identified a notable Absorbance of 1.8 in mixtures containing Almond Oil and Cetyl Alcohol, indicating potential synergistic effects in UV absorption efficiency.



Moreover, the Spectrometer Alpha-300, while observing samples of Almond Oil with the inclusion of Vitamin E, showed a peak at 700 nm. This wavelength highlights potential photoprotective properties linked to the presence of Cetyl Alcohol and Vitamin E together.

| Gas Chromatograph GC-2010   | Almond Oil, Gum      | 750 ppm    | Outlier  |

| Conductivity Meter CM-215   | Jojoba Oil Mixture   | 1500 uS/cm | Expected |



### Results and Discussions



Analyses using the **Titrator T-905** yielded an equivalent concentration of 0.05 M for combinations involving Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin. Such precision is crucial for adjusting formulations in commercial production processes of similar oil-based mixtures. The differences in conductivity ranging between 55 mM and 1500 uS/cm across various samples illustrate the predominance of ionic interactions, heavily influenced by matrix composition and environmental conditions.



Measurements with the **Viscometer VS-300** reveal a higher viscosity of 5149.99 cP in Coconut Oil with Cetyl Alcohol and Vitamin E composites compared to standalone Jojoba Oil recordings at 2516.16 cP. These parameters are essential in industrial formulations for viscosity control, ensuring appropriate flow properties in consumer applications.



### Conclusion



The analysis of oil-based samples through various advanced instrumentation techniques allowed the identification of key chemical and physical properties. The labsâ€™ systematic evaluations provide invaluable data supporting quality control and continuous product innovation. Future research should focus on probing deeper interactions within these mixtures to optimize formulations for both efficacy and consumer preference.
