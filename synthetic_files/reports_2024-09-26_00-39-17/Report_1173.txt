# Lab Report: Analysis of Oil Mixtures



### Report Number: 1173



This lab report details the analysis of various mixtures using advanced instrumentation. Each test sample is a unique combination of components analyzed to understand different physical and chemical properties. The instruments used include a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600, Liquid Chromatograph LC-400, X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000, Centrifuge X100, Conductivity Meter CM-215, Four Ball FB-1000, and Viscometer VS-300. Observations and measurements were meticulously recorded.



## Mixture Analysis: Almond Oil and Derivatives



### A. Spectrophotometric Analysis



The UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600 measured absorbance for mixtures containing Almond Oil. Notably:



- **Almond Oil with Gum:** Absorbance recorded was 3.2 Abs.

- **Almond Oil with Coconut Oil and Glycerin:** Not applicable in this section.



### B. Liquid Chromatography Results



The Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 facilitated the quantification of specific mixtures:



- **Almond Oil with unspecified additions:** Recorded a concentration of 250.5 ug/mL.

- **Almond Oil with Vitamin E:** Concentration measured as 100.8 ug/mL.



**Irrelevant Note:** The chromatographs were executed under standard lab temperature and humidity, although these factors are not known to significantly impact results within typical ranges.



### C. X-Ray Diffraction Study



Using the X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000, thermal properties were examined:



- **Almond Oil with Cetyl Alcohol:** Recorded transition temperature was around 120째C.



### D. Centrifugal Force Evaluation



The Centrifuge X100 examined rotational speeds:



- **Almond Oil with Gum and Vitamin E:** The sample was rotated at 14500 RPM, effectively separating the components.



**Observation:** Minor deviations were noted due to minor vibrations during setup, yet insignificant to affect results.



**Random Association:** Historical accounts of centrifugation date back to ancient techniques of manual separation in agriculture.



### E. Other Tests on Almond Oil Mixtures



The Four Ball FB-1000 test showcased wear resistance properties:



- **Almond Oil with Beeswax:** Wear scar diameter measured 0.750 mm.



## Jojoba Oil Mixture Evaluations



### A. Conductivity Measurements



- **Jojoba Oil with Beeswax and Vitamin E:** Conductivity recorded was 1500 uS/cm.



### B. Viscosity Evaluation



Conducted with the Viscometer VS-300:



- **Jojoba Oil with Gum:** Viscosity readings were 1917.43 cP and 1931.56 cP for repeated trials.



### C. Thermal and Structural Analysis



- **Jojoba Oil with Cetyl Alcohol and Glycerin:** A phase transition was observed at 60째C.



**Inconsequential Narrative:** Jojoba oil has been historically noted for traditional skin treatments, although the focus here is strictly scientific.



## Coconut Oil and Mixtures Analysis



### A. Spectroscopic Insight



Coconut Oil was examined via the UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, revealing:



- **Coconut Oil with Gum and Glycerin:** Absorbance detailed at 2.8 Abs.
