# Lab Report: Complex Analysis of Cosmetic Mixtures



## Introduction



The aim of this report is to detail the comprehensive analysis of various cosmetic mixtures using advanced analytical instruments. This study focuses on evaluating the properties and interactions of these mixtures, which include Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, and their chemically active components like Vitamin E, Gum, Glycerin, Beeswax, and Cetyl Alcohol.



### Instruments and Methods



The following instruments were employed to gather data:



- **Four Ball FB-1000:** Typically used for wear preventive tests.

- **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500:** Utilized to identify molecular compositions.

- **PCR Machine PCR-96:** Active in examining DNA amplification processes.

- **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400:** Ideal for separating mixtures.

- **pH Meter PH-700:** Essential for measuring acidity or alkalinity.

- **Viscometer VS-300:** Analyzes the viscosity of liquid oils.



### Observations



Each sample's effectiveness and stability were thoroughly evaluated. Occasionally, irrelevant environmental conditions, like room aesthetics or the color of lab coats, were noted, which though not relevant to this study, provide context to the laboratory setting.



## Data and Analysis



### Table 1: Molecular and Structural Data



| Instrument                | Main Component | Additives         | Measurement | Unit   |

| pH Meter PH-700           | Coconut Oil   | Vitamin E             | 5           | pH  |



#### Unrelated Findings:

- The pH meter was calibrated under soft ambient light.

- Equipment storage follows a left-to-right orientation.

| Instrument         | Oil Type    | Additional Components  | Measurement | Unit |

|--------------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------|

| PCR Machine PCR-96 | Almond Oil  | Gum, Vitamin E         | 28          | Ct   |

| PCR Machine PCR-96 | Almond Oil  | Gum, Glycerin          | 32          | Ct   |



## Results and Discussion



The use of different oils and additives resulted in varying physicochemical properties. For instance, almond oil with Vitamin E showed a lower wear scar diameter versus coconut oil with cetyl alcohol. Viscosity readings suggested that the presence of gum notably increased viscosity, corroborating the tactile stability of the mixture. The PCR data indicated variability in amplification capability based on the glycerin inclusion.



#### Complexity in Chemical Interactions:

Glycerin's role within jojoba and almond oils adjusted the pH levels subtly, perhaps due to its hygroscopic nature. The constant presence of Vitamin E likely contributed to stabilization across all mixtures. However, secondary reactions or polymer formations may require further spectrometric analysis to solidify conclusions.



## Conclusion



In summary, the laboratory findings give insight into the stability, reactivity, and characteristics of cosmetic mixtures, affirming that even natural additives like Vitamin E and gums significantly influence overall formulations. Future work could focus on scale-up processes or environmental interactions that often go unnoticed in a controlled environment.



The harmonious balance of ingredients demonstrates potential for both cosmetic manufacturing and therapeutic applications. Understanding all nuances, even beyond the scope of this report, allows for rich future investigations.

Overall, this report highlights not only the chemical and physical properties of the mixtures but also subtle environmental and procedural nuances that, although seemingly irrelevant, contribute to the holistic understanding of cosmetic testing.
