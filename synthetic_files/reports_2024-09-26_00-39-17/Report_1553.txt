| Instrument                | Mixture                     | Measurement | Units  |

|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|--------|

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin  | 25.6        | µg/mL  |

| HPLC System HPLC-9000     | Almond Oil, Beeswax        | 750         | mg/L   |

| Viscometer VS-300         | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 7298.01    | cP     |

| Viscometer VS-300         | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 2773.44    | cP     |



+ Elevated concentration readings may be due to instrument calibration errors.



## Discussion



The analysis demonstrated varied properties across the different mixtures. Noteworthy observations include the high viscosity of the Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E mixture, which shows a notably higher cP compared to others. Moreover, the UV-Vis Absorption data indicated a distinct interaction between Vitamin E and Beeswax, highlighting the potential for further research into compound interaction effects.



The wear resistance indicated by the Four Ball Machine provides insights into the application performance of Coconut Oil. Such resilience in wear was generally anticipated based on known material properties.



### Conclusion



This study successfully characterized the different mixtures, utilizing a comprehensive array of laboratory instrumentation to gather critical data on various chemical and physical properties. Future research should address noted inconsistencies and expand upon the interaction analysis of Vitamins and oils in personal care formulations.
