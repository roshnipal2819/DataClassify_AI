# Laboratory Report: Analysis of Oil Samples with Various Additives



## Report ID: 1755



### Introduction



In this experiment, we performed a comprehensive analysis on several oil samples combined with different additives using multiple analytical techniques. The objective was to measure the chemical and physical properties of these complex mixtures. Each mixture was analyzed using the following instruments: Gas Chromatograph GC-2010, Four Ball FB-1000, NMR Spectrometer NMR-500, Liquid Chromatograph LC-400, Titrator T-905, and Viscometer VS-300.



### Methodology



A detailed procedure involved preparing each test sample by mixing base oils (Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil) with varying additives (Vitamin E, Beeswax, Gum, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol). Each sample underwent a series of tests designed to evaluate its purity, viscosity, reactivity, and wear resistance.
