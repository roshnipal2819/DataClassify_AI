### Analytical Techniques



#### Spectrometric Analysis

The use of Spectrometer Alpha-300 on mixtures such as Coconut Oil with Vitamin E and Almond Oil with Beeswax and Vitamin E, revealed distinct peaks in the visible region (550.7 nm and 720.3 nm, respectively). The changes in wavelength denote significant interactions between the oil and vitamin additives, possibly indicative of structural homogenization or bonding variations.



#### Chromatographic Insights

The Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 evaluated the purity and concentration of Jojoba Oil, exhibiting a concentration of 95.2 Âµg/mL. Contrastingly, the Ion Chromatograph IC-2100 highlighted a moderate ionic concentration of 15.3 mM in Coconut Oil combined with Beeswax.

#### Unexpected Findings

During analysis, it was documented that certain mixtures, particularly those involving glycerin, posed challenges in achieving homogeneity. Additionally, the interaction between different additives such as beeswax and vitamin E revealed complex layering under microscopic observation.



### Conclusion

The analysis underscored the diverse chemical behaviors exhibited by different oil-additive mixtures. Specifically, interactions noted through spectrometric wavelengths and chromatography highlighted significant chemical and structural variations. The viscosity measurements, particularly of the Jojoba Oil mixtures, accentuated the complex rheological properties inherent to each mixture type.



Further testing may delve into the microstructural evaluation to discern the exact nature of the observed spectral and chromatographic phenomena. Exploratory studies involving more advanced spectrometry techniques could also lend greater insight into the molecular dynamics at play.
