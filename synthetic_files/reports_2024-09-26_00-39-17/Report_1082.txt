**Observations:**

- The FTIR results suggest a strong chemical interaction between Jojoba Oil and Beeswax, evident from prominent peaks at 1200 1/cm.

- UV-Vis absorption at 2.1 Abs for the Jojoba-Oil-Gum-Vitamin-E mixture underscores potential UV protective capabilities.



### Table 4: Chromatographic and Mass Analysis



| Instrument                 | Test Sample           | Measurement | Units |

|----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------|

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax | 25          | ug/mL |

| HPLC System HPLC-9000      | Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E | 200         | mg/L |

| Mass Spectrometer MS-20    | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol | 450       | m/z   |



**Observations:**

- Mass spectrometry identified a principal compound with a mass-to-charge ratio of 450 m/z in the Coconut Oil and Cetyl Alcohol mixture, suggesting the presence of a long-chain ester.



## Discussion



The analyses conducted herein reveal intricate interactions between natural oils and their supplemental compounds. Most notably, Vitamin E's role in reducing the viscosity could potentially modulate sensory attributes in topical preparations. Correspondingly, spectroscopic and chromatographic data highlighted structural compatibilities and potential functional benefits such as enhanced stability and antioxidant properties. 



**Irrelevant Observation:** The lab coat worn during trials was a pristine white, unlikely to impact results but noteworthy. 



## Conclusion



In summary, the diversified application of advanced instrumentation has furnished a robust analytical framework for understanding oil-based mixtures with diverse potentialities in product development. The data underscores the vital role of systematic evaluation in uncovering opportunities for innovation within the formulation landscape.
