### Observations and Measurements



Below, we present a summary of findings and measurements taken across various instruments for each mixture:



#### Table 1: Gas Chromatographer GC-2010 Measurements (ppm)

| Sample | Ingredient 1 | Ingredient 2   | Ingredient 3 | Measurement |

|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|

| 1      | Jojoba Oil   | Cetyl Alcohol  |              | 250 ppm     |

| 2      | Jojoba Oil   | Gum            |              | 450 ppm     |

| 3      | Almond Oil   | Cetyl Alcohol  |              | 780 ppm     |

| 4      | Jojoba Oil   | Gum            | Vitamin E    | 600 ppm     |



#### Table 2: Spectrometer Alpha-300 Data (nm)

| Sample | Primary Oil | Additive 1     | Additive 2 | Wavelength | Noise Level |

|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|------------|-------------|

| A      | Jojoba Oil  | Cetyl Alcohol  |            | 350 nm     | 3 dB        |

| B      | Almond Oil  | Beeswax        |            | 990 nm     | 7 dB        |

| C      | Jojoba Oil  | Gum            |            | 490 nm     | 4 dB        |



The wavelength data suggests a variance in the absorption profile, particularly in almond oil combinations, indicative of complex molecular interactions.

### Results and Interpretations



**Optical Density (OD) Analysis with Microplate Reader MRX:**



The optical density measurements revealed varying degrees of light absorption across the spectrum. Notably, mixtures containing Vitamin E exhibited higher OD values, with implications for enhanced antioxidant properties.



#### Table 3: Microplate Reader MRX Optical Density Measurements (OD)

| Sample    | Mixture Components       | OD Value |

|-----------|--------------------------|----------|

| Jojoba A  | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol| 2.5      |

| Jojoba B  | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E| 3.0      |



**Thermal and X-Ray Diffractometer Observations:**



The thermocycler and XRD results corroborate the role of each additive in altering the thermal stability of the oils. Among the notable findings was the temperature elevation in coconut oil blends when glycerin was present, although seemingly irrelevant due to unrelated compounds.



**Irrelevant Note:** On a separate note, the setup of the thermocycler required a recalibration due to ambient fluctuations, an aspect unrelated to the spectra gathered.



#### Table 4: X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000 Temperature Results (C)

| Sample  | Primary Components | X-Ray Temp |

|---------|--------------------|------------|

| X1      | Jojoba + Cetyl     | 80 C       |

| X2      | Almond + Gum       | 95 C       |



### Viscometer Observations



Complex viscosity profiles emerged, with almond oil and beeswax mixtures presenting notably high viscosities. In contrast, jojoba mixtures demonstrated a lower resistance to flow, suggesting its potential in smoother formulations.



#### Table 5: Viscometer VS-300 Viscosity Measurements (cP)

| Description          | Combination                      | Viscosity  |

|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|

| Coconut Oil          | Cetyl Alcohol + Glycerin         | 5186.51 cP |

| Almond Oil           | Beeswax                          | 7192.87 cP |



### Conclusion



The comprehensive analysis reveals that oil mixtures exhibit distinct chemical and physical properties, influenced by their respective components. This report serves as an extensive database for future research on optimizing formulations for industrial applications.
