| Instrument            | Mixture                      | Measurement Type | Value       |

|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------|-------------|

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | Concentration   | 45.8 µg/mL  |

| Centrifuge X100       | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | Speed            | 13500 RPM  |

| Rheometer R-4500      | Almond Oil                   | Viscosity        | 250 Pa-s    |



#### Insights



- The **Liquid Chromatograph** revealed a concentration of 45.8 µg/mL for the Vitamin E in the Coconut Oil and Beeswax mixture, indicating effective dispersal of Vitamin E within the lipid matrix.



- Using the **Centrifuge X100**, a formidable centrifugal force allowed the separation of glycerin within the Jojoba Oil and Beeswax mix, providing efficient stratification for further analysis.



### Table 3: Electrical and Rheological Characteristics



| Instrument              | Mixture                  | Measurement Type | Measurement  |

|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------|

| Conductivity Meter CM-215 | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | Conductivity    | 750 μS/cm   |

| pH Meter PH-700         | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | pH              | 8.5         |



#### Considerations



- An intriguing observation related to the **Conductivity Meter** indicated that the Almond Oil mixture demonstrates moderate ionic presence with 750 µS/cm, possibly due to the emulsifying effect of beeswax facilitating the ionic dispersion of Vitamin E.



- The pH of 8.5 for Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E mixture may suggest compatibility for cosmetic applications requiring a slightly alkaline pH.



### Table 4: Viscosity Analysis



| Instrument        | Mixture                             | Viscosity      |

|-------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|

| Viscometer VS-300 | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E      | 7348.69 cP     |

| Viscometer VS-300 | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 7313.08 cP     |

| Viscometer VS-300 | Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E               | 2681.03 cP     |



#### Summary



- The viscosity readings portray the intricate balance required in manufacturing scenarios where precise flow characteristics are crucial. The diverse viscosities, with a high value of 7348.69 cP for the Almond Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E mixture, reflect their robust potential in applications necessitating a thicker consistency.

  

- Meanwhile, a lower viscosity of 2681.03 cP for Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E highlights its potential for lighter formulations.



## Conclusion



The results from various tests collectively contribute invaluable data, unraveling the properties of these complex mixtures. This report affirms the significance of utilizing multifaceted instruments to holistically capture the characteristics of material samples in laboratory conditions. Such comprehensive analysis aids in refining product formulations across industrial applications, pushing the boundaries of scientific inquiry further.



## Notes



It is noteworthy that some instruments showcase deviations in measurements occasionally—requiring recalibration. Future work should consider cross-referencing results with additional replicates to enhance the data reliability.
