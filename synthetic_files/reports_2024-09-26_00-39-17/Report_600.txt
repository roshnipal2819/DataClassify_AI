## Introduction



This lab report details the analysis of various oil mixtures using multiple instruments. Each mixture's composition and properties were investigated using contemporary analytical techniques. The analysis focused on understanding the physical and chemical characteristics of each sample.



## Experimental Setup and Methodology



The following instruments were utilized to assess the properties of the different oil mixtures:



1. **Centrifuge X100**: Utilized for separating components based on density.

2. **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600**: Used to measure the absorbance of the samples.

3. **Gas Chromatograph GC-2010**: Employed to understand the chemical composition.

4. **Titrator T-905**: For determining the concentration of specific compounds.

5. **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000**: Applied to analyze crystal structures.

6. **Viscometer VS-300**: Used to measure the viscosity of the mixtures.



### Materials Analyzed



- **Coconut Oil Mixtures**: with Vitamin E, Beeswax

- **Jojoba Oil Mixtures**: with Beeswax, Gum, Glycerin

- **Almond Oil Mixtures**: with Gum



## Observations



During the experiments, it was noted that the color and consistency of each mixture varied significantly with composition changes. For instance, the presence of Beeswax often resulted in a notable thickening of the mixtures.



**Irrelevant Information**: The lab was conducted while a classic rock station played in the background, potentially influencing the mood of the researchers involved, although there's no quantifiable effect on the results.



## Results



Below are the detailed results obtained from various instruments, categorized by the type of oil mixture and instrument used:



### Table 1: Centrifuge Analysis



| Sample Composition (Oil and Additives) | Instrument        | Measurement |

|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|

| Coconut Oil, Vitamin E                 | Centrifuge X100   | 10250 RPM   |



### Table 2: Spectroscopic Analysis



| Sample Composition (Oil and Additives) | Instrument              | Measurement |

|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|

| Coconut Oil, Glycerin                  | UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600 | 2.7 Abs |



### Table 3: Gas Chromatographic Analysis



| Sample Composition     | Instrument     | Measurement |

|------------------------|----------------|-------------|

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | Gas Chromatograph GC-2010 | 450 ppm    |



**Irrelevant Details**: Room temperature was recorded continuously but showed negligible fluctuations, maintaining an average of 22°C.



### Table 4: Titration Analysis



| Sample Composition (Oil and Additives) | Instrument | Measurement  |

|----------------------------------------|------------|--------------|

| Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E        | Titrator T-905 | 9.5 M      |



### Table 5: Structural Analysis



| Sample Composition (Oil and Additives) | Instrument | Measurement |

|----------------------------------------|------------|-------------|

| Almond Oil, Gum                        | X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000 | 137 °C    	     |



### Table 6: Viscosity Measurements



| Sample Composition             | Instrument   | Measurement (cP) |

|--------------------------------|--------------|------------------|

| Coconut Oil, Beeswax           | Viscometer VS-300 | 4821.85        |

| Coconut Oil, Vitamin E         | Viscometer VS-300 | 4937.16        |

| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin      | Viscometer VS-300 | 1936.47        |



## Discussion



The viscosity measurements indicated that the presence of Vitamin E increases the viscosity of Coconut Oil mixtures slightly more than Beeswax. In contrast, Jojoba Oil mixtures showed the lowest viscosity values among all samples, suggesting potential ease of application in cosmetic formulations. 



The UV-Vis Spectrophotometer results underscored Coconut Oil's absorbance properties when combined with Glycerin, a property useful for analyzing potential sunscreen formulations. Furthermore, the GC-2010 analysis pointed out that Jojoba Oil mixtures contain significant Glycerin concentrations, confirming its high miscibility and stability.



**Irrelevant Conclusion**: The overall ambience of the lab was conducive to reflective contemplation, possibly aiding in the thoroughness of the tests conducted.



## Conclusion



This multifaceted analysis offered insights into the behavior of various oil mixtures, highlighting their potential applications in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Each technique applied provided unique data points that contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the sample characteristics.
