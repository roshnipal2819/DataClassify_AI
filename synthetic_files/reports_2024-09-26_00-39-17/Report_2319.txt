## Introduction



The purpose of this experiment was to analyze several mixtures composed of various oils, gums, alcohol derivatives, and vitamins. Each mixture was subjected to different scientific instruments to ascertain physical and chemical properties, providing insight into their potential applications in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other commercial products. 



### Methodology



Each sample mixture was treated as a single test entity for the purpose of this study, utilizing sophisticated instruments to derive meaningful data about their properties. The laboratory employed advanced equipment, including rheometers, mass spectrometers, gas chromatographs, spectrometers, PCR machines, and viscometers. 



The objectives were to determine viscosity, molecular mass distribution, volatile compound concentration, spectral characteristics, melt behavior, and reaction cycles. Irrelevant nuances were encountered throughout the process but did not deter the progress or accuracy of the experiment.

## Experimental Data and Observations



### Table 1: Rheological and Molecular Analysis  

| Instrument            | Sample Mixture      | Measurement Type     | Value  | Unit |

|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|------|

| Rheometer R-4500      | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin | Viscosity           | 785    | Pa-s |

| Mass Spectrometer MS-20 | Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E | Molecular Ion (m/z) | 589    | m/z |



#### Observations:

- Jojoba Oil, Gum, and Glycerin exhibited a notably high viscosity, indicating potential utility for thickening applications.

- The m/z value for Almond Oil with Gum and Vitamin E suggests a mid-range molecular weight, relevant in fragrance or light skincare product development.



*Note: An unexpected temperature gradient was noted which required recalibration of the rheometer mid-testing.*

### Table 2: Chromatographic and Spectral Characteristics

| Instrument               | Sample Mixture                | Measurement Type     | Value  | Unit |

|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|--------|------|

| Gas Chromatograph GC-2010| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E     | Concentration        | 450    | ppm  |

| Spectrometer Alpha-300   | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol      | Wavelength           | 300    | nm   |



#### Observations:

- Jojoba Oil mixed with Gum and Vitamin E has a concentration that supports effective dispersal properties in formulations.

- The spectral absorption of Jojoba Oil with Cetyl Alcohol implies potential UV protective benefits.



*Additional Detail: While calibrating the spectrometer, extraneous electrical fluctuations influenced initial readings, necessitating repeat trials.*

### Table 3: Viscosity and PCR Cycle Threshold 

| Instrument               | Sample Mixture                | Measurement Type    | Value   | Unit |

|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------|------|

| PCR Machine PCR-96       | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | Cycle Threshold (Ct)| 22      | Ct   |

| Viscometer VS-300        | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | Viscosity         | 7105.32| cP   |

| Viscometer VS-300        | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | Viscosity           | 7185.05| cP   |



#### Observations:

- The PCR cycle threshold of 22 highlights the potential for activating bio-compounds within Jojoba formulations.

- Viscous measurements for Almond Oil-based samples indicate a high level of stability and structural integrity.



*Remark: Transient magnetic fields incurred indirect effects on PCR machine readings, which were corrected via control tests.*

## Conclusion



Our comprehensive study provides a robust understanding of the physical and chemical properties of various oil-based mixtures. The findings indicate potentials for high viscosity and stability, pertinent applications in personal care and industrial products.



Despite certain challenges encountered during the experimental proceedings—such as equipment recalibration due to irrelevant electromagnetic disturbances—the accuracy and reliability of the results remain uncompromised.



### Future Work



Further investigation is advised to encompass extended environmental factors, alongside software enhancements for data analysis automation to mitigate irregular data interference.
