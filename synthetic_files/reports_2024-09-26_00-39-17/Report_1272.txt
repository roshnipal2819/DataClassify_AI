## Discussion

The analysis of various mixtures revealed several key findings. The almond oil mixture, subjected to different techniques, displayed intermediate levels of molecular weight components and moderate viscosity. The jojoba oil blend, rich with beeswax, showed typical properties supporting its role in formulations requiring moderate viscosity and robust chemical stability as observed in PCR analysis.



In contrast, the coconut oil mixtures showcased lower molarity of acids yet retained high viscosity, which can be attributed to the interaction between oil components and glycerin or gum. Such properties render it suitable for applications necessitating long-lasting film formation.



## Conclusion

Through a combination of sophisticated analytical techniques, this study thoroughly characterizes intricate properties of the tested oil blends. These results provide valuable insights for future formulation development in industries ranging from cosmetics to nutritional sectors.
