# Lab Report: Analysis of Various Oil-Based Mixtures



**Report ID**: Report_1367  

**Date**: [Insert Date]



## Introduction



This report presents the analytical findings for multiple oil-based mixtures tested using sophisticated laboratory instruments. The aim of these tests was to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of combinations containing oils, alcohols, vitamins, waxes, and more. Each combination was treated as a unique test sample. The complex interplay of ingredients within each sample often yielded insights into their potential usability in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.



## Experimental Setup



The test samples were formulated by combining different oils with either vitamins, alcohols, gums, or waxes:



- **Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E**

- **Coconut Oil, Beeswax**

- **Almond Oil, Vitamin E**

- **Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E**

- **Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin**



Each mixture was subjected to analytical techniques including spectrometry, ion chromatography, liquid chromatography, and viscosity measurement.

## Observations and Measurements



**Table 1: Spectrometry Analysis**



| Spectrometer | Sample Mixture                  | Wavelength (nm) |

|--------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|

| Alpha-300    | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 460             |

| Alpha-300    | Jojoba Oil, Gum                 | 550             |



These readings indicate the absorbance peak wavelengths of specific components, which can correlate to their functional efficacy.



**Unrelated Fact:**  

The color wavelength range can sometimes mislead chemists into overlooking impurities.



**Table 2: Ion Chromatography**



| Ion Chromatograph | Sample Mixture         | Concentration (mM) |

|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|

| IC-2100           | Coconut Oil, Beeswax   | 25                 |

| IC-2100           | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | 40               |



Ion chromatography confirms the ionic content present in the mixture, reflecting the emulsifying capabilities.

**Table 3: Liquid Chromatography**



| Liquid Chromatograph | Sample Mixture               | Concentration (Âµg/mL) |

|----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|

| LC-400               | Almond Oil, Vitamin E        | 75                    |

| LC-400               | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 150                   |



The difference in Vitamin E concentration is instrumental in determining antioxidant protection levels.



**Note:**  

The LC system occasionally requires recalibration, but this is unrelated to the presented results.



## Results and Discussion



**Viscosity Measurements:**



**Table 4: Viscosity**



| Viscometer | Sample Mixture                 | Viscosity (cP) |

|------------|--------------------------------|----------------|

| VS-300     | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 5145.92       |

| VS-300     | Almond Oil, Beeswax            | 7233.91        |

| VS-300     | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E     | 2083.34        |



Viscosity was directly related to the oil and wax types. Higher viscosities are characteristic of mixtures with substantial wax content (e.g., Almond Oil, Beeswax).



**Note on Irrelevant Information:**  

Viscosity data can be pivotal, yet it may not always correlate with user sensory feedback.



**pH Analysis:**



- **Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E** showed a pH value of **7**, which is ideal for skin applications often seeking neutrality.



Extensive evaluations concluded that pH stability across formulations with Glycerin and Vitamin E is highly beneficial in maintaining product efficacy over time.

## Conclusion



The analytical dataset provided valuable insights into the complex nature of oil-based cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations. This study's detailed methodologies highlighted essential correlations between ingredient combinations and their physical properties, such as absorption spectra and viscosities. 



The tested parameters suggest potential applications for the samples ranging in categories from skincare to industrial lubrication, with specific roles identified based on their intrinsic physicochemical characteristics. Further explorations, particularly into emulsifying abilities and long-term stability studies, are recommended.



**Note:** Despite the occasional presence of unrelated notes, each tested sample offers unique benefits and challenges that future formulation work should consider.
