# Lab Report 2057



## Introduction



This report presents the results obtained from a series of tests conducted on various mixtures using advanced scientific equipment. The goal was to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of each formulation. The tests performed include PCR, FTIR spectroscopy, conductivity, microplate reading, lubrication measurement, and x-ray diffraction analysis. Each group of ingredients was treated as a single test sample. The intricate nature of the data necessitates careful interpretation and analysis, as disparate information and irrelevant details have been intentionally included for complexity.



## Methodology



### Equipment and Materials



- **PCR Machine**: PCR-96

- **FTIR Spectrometer**: FTIR-8400

6. **Mixture F**: Coconut Oil, Beeswax

7. **Mixture G**: Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin



### Test Procedures



Experiments were conducted by applying specific samples to each instrument to observe and log various measurements, such as optical density (OD), wavelength (1/cm), conductivity (uS/cm), etc.

### Table 2: Viscosity Analysis



| Equipment       | Sample Ingredients         | Measurement  | Unit |

|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------|------|

| Viscometer VS-300 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax      | 4774.68      | cP   |

| Viscometer VS-300 | Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin | 7752.04      | cP   |



### Irrelevant Scatterings



- **Random Detail**: The ambient temperature throughout testing was consistently maintained at approximately 22Â°C.

- **Non-Essential Measurement**: Power consumption during testing fluctuated minimally, averaging around 150 W.



## Discussion



The results indicated a diverse range of interactions among the various mixtures, leading to significant variation in the measured properties. Notably, **Mixture B** showed a substantial FTIR absorbance, emphasizing the presence of coconut oil and glycerin's overlapping bands. In contrast, **Mixture A** demonstrated a pronounced Ct value in the PCR assay, indicative of unique DNA amplification properties perhaps due to the inclusion of Vitamin E.



The conductance of **Mixture D** implied that a significant amount of ionic content, likely introduced by the gum, was present. Meanwhile, the viscosity tests revealed **Mixture G** as the most viscous, suggesting strong intermolecular forces perhaps introduced by the combination of Almond Oil and Glycerin.



Measurements across multiple modalities highlighted the nuances in properties each unique combination of ingredients exhibited, providing valuable insights into their potential applications in formulations where specific characteristics such as viscosity or conductivity are desired.



## Conclusion



The extensive data accrued from these tests underscores the complex interplay of components within the analyzed mixtures. The intricacies of these reactions not only contribute to fundamental scientific understanding but also have practical implications in product formulation and optimization. Further exploration could ascertain the benefits and applications of these distinctive mixtures.
