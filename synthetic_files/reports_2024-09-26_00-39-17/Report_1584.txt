# Lab Report: Evaluation of Various Oil Compositions



## Introduction



This report documents the analytical evaluation of oil samples containing different compositions using various instrumental methodologies. Key components such as Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Vitamin E, and others were analyzed to determine specific characteristics such as concentration, temperature stability, and viscosity.



## Instrumentation and Analytical Techniques



Three different instrumental techniques were utilized in this study:



1. **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100** - Used for precise measurement of ionic components in Almond Oil mixtures.

   

2. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500** - Implemented for assessing Coconut Oil mixtures to determine molecular configurations.

   

3. **Viscometer VS-300** - Employed to measure the viscosity of various oil and glycerin mixtures. 



4. **Thermocycler TC-5000** - Used to determine thermal stability of Almond Oil samples.



5. **PCR Machine PCR-96** - Quantified certain components through cycle threshold (Ct) in Almond Oil-based mixtures.



6. **HPLC System HPLC-9000** - Assessed concentrations in Coconut Oil mixtures with high pressure liquid chromatography.



## Observations and Measurements



### Table 1: Ion Chromatographic Analysis

| Sample Composition        | Instrument             | Concentration (mM)   | 

|----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | Ion Chromatograph IC-2100 | 75.3                 |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | Ion Chromatograph IC-2100 | 65.1                 |



Unexpected deviation in ionic absorption was noted for the Almond Oil and Cetyl Alcohol complex. Not applicable variations were observed in minor components.



### Table 2: Viscosity Measurements

| Sample Composition     | Instrument        | Viscosity (cP)         |

|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|

| Almond Oil, Glycerin   | Viscometer VS-300 | 7399.91                |

| Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin | Viscometer VS-300 | 7716.63                |



The viscosity of Almond Oil and Gum mixture showed a significant increase, indicating strong intermolecular interactions.

### Table 3: Thermal Stability and NMR Analysis

| Sample Composition      | Instrument              | Temperature/Chemical Shift |

|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | Thermocycler TC-5000 | 36 °C                    |

| Coconut Oil              | NMR Spectrometer NMR-500 | 15.8 ppm                   |



Thermal analysis revealed consistent stability up to 36 °C for the Almond Oil and Vitamin E mixture. NMR spectra indicated chemical shifts that were consistent with linear glycerides.



### Table 4: HPLC and PCR Analysis

| Sample Composition     | Instrument       | Measurement (mg/L/Ct)   |

|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|

| Coconut Oil, Beeswax   | HPLC System HPLC-9000 | 450.9 mg/L             |

| Almond Oil, Vitamin E  | PCR Machine PCR-96 | 28.5 Ct                 |



Concentration maxima observed in Coconut Oil combinations using HPLC, contrasted with the Almond Oil-based PCR results that necessitated further amplification cycles.



## Discussion



The varied results across different instrumental methods highlight the complexity of oil mixtures. The Ion Chromatograph and NMR results point towards interesting characteristics, such as the mutual compatibility of Cetyl Alcohol with different oils. Viscosity analysis also underscores the importance of specific interactions between oils and other ingredients like Glycerin and Gum.



### Additional Section: Anecdotal Observations

An unconnected anecdote involves a misalignment during the storage process, leading to a temperature drift that underlines the importance of precise environmental controls.



## Conclusion



This detailed examination of oil mixtures reveals critical insights into their chemical and physical properties. Discrepancies between different datasets emphasize the necessity for comprehensive analysis using multifaceted instrumental techniques. Furthermore, the inclusion of unrelated data illustrates the complexity involved in comprehensive report fabrications.



The findings comply with the expected profiles for these materials, though minor variances warrant further examination. Future studies should address the unidentified anomalies to refine our understanding of component interactions.
