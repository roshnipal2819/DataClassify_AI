Irrelevant information: Our lunch break was held at 12:30 PM every day, during which time the lab equipment was powered down. 



#### Complex Descriptions:



The viscosity research was specially noted for the Almond Oil and Gum mixture, displaying anomalously high cP values that suggest a unique interaction at the molecular level, potentially driven by shear-thickening behavior. This aligns with the recorded OD from the MRX readings, displaying optical density changes corresponding to structural modifications in emulsified systems.

### Discussion



The testing methodology highlights the utility of multi-instrument approaches for comprehensive substance evaluation. For instance, using the IC-2100 provides mM concentration insights that align well with viscosity data from the VS-300, necessitating further exploration into the atomic level interactions. Simultaneously, spectral analysis through the Alpha-300 highlights electronic transitions unique to these oil mixtures, crucial for understanding absorptive properties.



Extraneous data observation: Vending machine restocking occurred every Thursday, briefly affecting the team's focus.
