### Observations

1. **Mass Spectrometry**: The m/z ratio of 1350 for the Almond Oil and Glycerin mixture suggests possible complex formation, indicative of heavier molecules or combined compounds.

2. **Conductivity Measurements**: For Coconut Oil with Beeswax and Vitamin E, a significantly high conductivity of 1500 uS/cm was noted, which may imply ionic interactions within the mixture.

3. **Gas Chromatography**: Offered a ppm value of 250 for Almond Oil mixed with Gum and Glycerin, providing insight into volatile compound presence.

4. **Viscosity Analysis**: Jojoba Oil with Gum and Glycerin yielded a viscosity measure suggesting greater fluid movement compared to other combinations.



Notably, the X-Ray Diffractometer and NMR Spectrometer supplied further intricate data, highlighting different states of matter and molecular interactions not covered broadly in this report.
