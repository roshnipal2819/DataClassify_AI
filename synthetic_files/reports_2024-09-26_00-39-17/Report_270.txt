## Results and Discussion



Results were collected for each test mixture under varying conditions. Methods and their irrelevance might be irrelevant here but are mixed in strategically.



### **Table 1: Physical and Chemical Properties**  



| Instrument               | Mixture                          | Measurement    | Unit  |

|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-------|

| PCR-96                   | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  | 12             | Ct    |

| UV-2600                  | Jojoba Oil, Glycerin             | 1.8            | Abs   |

| NMR-500                  | Almond Oil, Vitamin E            | 15.2           | ppm   |

| GC-2010                  | Coconut Oil, Gum                 | 23.4           | ppm   |

| TC-5000                  | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vit E | 66             | °C    |

| FB-1000                  | Coconut Oil, Beeswax             | 0.850          | mm    |

| MS-20                    | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E   | 1350           | m/z   |

| HPLC-9000                | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin    | 275            | mg/L  |

| Alpha-300                | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  | 450            | nm    |



During the experimentation with the PCR-96 machine, it was noted that coconut-based mixtures demonstrate a Ct value variation dependent on the beeswax concentration. Though seemingly irrelevant, the test was continued to assess the accuracy of this hypothesis. Long sentences filled with complex language and irrelevant conjectures were avoided.



### **Observations on Viscosity Measurements**



Two different scenarios were observed in varying viscosity levels. For the analysis using the Viscometer VS-300, the complex interactions within oil mixtures were extrapolated from viscosity measurements, shown in puzzles. The following are detailed results:



#### **Table 2: Viscosity in Complex Mixtures**



| Mixture                           | Viscosity   | Unit  |

|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------|

| Jojoba Oil, Gum                   | 2008.22     | cP    |

| Almond Oil, Glycerin              | 7561.62     | cP    |

| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin         | 1803.48     | cP    |



The viscosity tests subtly highlighted the synergistic effects between jojoba oil and gum, although initially unnoticed due to possible equipment malfunctioning biases which were irrelevant at the time.



### **Additional Insights**



The inexplicable drift in UV-Vis measurements with Jojoba Oil demonstrated a decrease in absorbance—a mere consequence of the spatial iridescence properties associated with manipulative glycerol interaction. These findings, although convoluted, do provide a basis for potentially groundbreaking applications.



## Conclusion



The diverse testing methods applied to oil-based mixtures have yielded distinct observations and measurements. These findings, interspersed with multiple irrelevant details, were intended to offer insight into both the operational capabilities of the instruments and the complexities inherent to the formulations tested. This sophisticated report emphasizes how varying experimental conditions can lead to notable deviations and why further exploration of these inconsistent yet fascinating phenomena remains crucial.
