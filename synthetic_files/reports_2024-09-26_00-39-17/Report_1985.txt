# Laboratory Report



## Introduction



This report details the testing and chemical analysis of various mixtures using different types of oils, waxes, and alcohol. Each mixture underwent a set of tests to measure temperature stability, conductivity, concentration of volatile compounds, magnetic resonance properties, and liquid chromatography separation. The observations and readings from these tests are essential for understanding the properties of these compounds.



### Background Information



In this study, we used primarily Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil, and Coconut Oil as the base liquids. Additives such as Beeswax, Glycerin, Vitamin E, and Cetyl Alcohol were incorporated to assess their influence on the tested properties.

## Methodology



Each sample was subjected to five different analytical techniques:



1. **Thermocycler TC-5000** for temperature measurements.

2. **Conductivity Meter CM-215** for electrical conductivity.

3. **Gas Chromatograph GC-2010** for detecting volatile organic compounds.

4. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500** for nuclear magnetic resonance.

5. **HPLC System HPLC-9000** for high-pressure liquid chromatography.

## Results and Discussion



### Complex Descriptions of Chemical Properties



While conducting the thermal analysis using the Thermocycler TC-5000, variability in temperature resistance was noted across samples. It was particularly intriguing how Almond Oil, when mixed with Beeswax and Glycerin, stabilized at a relatively low temperature of 23°C. Comparatively, Coconut Oil with Cetyl Alcohol yielded the highest temperature reading, suggesting an interaction that elevates thermal stability.  



#### Irrelevant Details to Consider



Though possibly unrelated, the external laboratory environment, such as the presence of ambient sulfur compounds, may influence correlated conductometry readings. Jojoba Oil mixtures consistently showed intermediate conductivity, likely due to its inherent polyunsaturated characteristics.



### Complex Result Interpretations



The dynamic range of NMR readings underscored, first, the relative stability of the molecular arrangement in the Coconut Oil and Glycerin mixture and, second, the different magnetic resonance behaviors due to intermolecular interactions. The diverse HPLC outcomes reveal potential applicability in flavoring or fragrance industries, mainly linked to the sharp separation noted in Coconut Oil with Cetyl Alcohol.

## Conclusion



The multiple analytical techniques employed offered substantive insights into the chemical behavior of the test mixtures. Coconut Oil mixtures, particularly with Cetyl Alcohol, demonstrated unique properties across several metric axes. The interpreted data hint at broader industrial applicability powered by distinct electrical, thermal, and chromatic properties, providing a springboard for further, more targeted studies.



### Endnotes



This report indicates the potential for a dynamic mix of parameters affecting chemical behavior, with each sample posing unique traits across the tested dimensions. Future research may target specific oil mixtures for detailed phase behavior and surface interaction studies.
