# Lab Report: Analysis of Cosmetic Mixtures 



## Introduction



The purpose of this lab report is to document the results of various analytical tests conducted on different cosmetic mixtures. The testing was conducted using multiple instruments, each tailored to evaluate specific properties of these mixtures. Through UV-Vis spectrophotometry, FTIR spectroscopy, rheometry, and more, we have assessed the compositional and physical properties of each mixture to provide detailed insights. Note that extraneous data is included to ensure comprehensive documentation.



## Experimental Methodology



### 1. UV-Vis Spectrophotometry



UV-Vis Spectrophotometry is employed to measure the absorbance of light by the samples. It is critical in determining the concentration of active components in each mixture.



### 2. Fourier-transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy



FTIR Spectroscopy identifies functional groups within mixtures through characteristic peaks measured in 1/cm. This method provides molecular identification that is crucial for understanding the structural composition.



### 3. Rheometry



Rheometric analysis helps in understanding the flow characteristics of the mixtures, giving insight into their viscosity and elasticity. 



### 4. Conductivity Measurement



Conductivity measurements are used to assess the ionic content of oil-based mixtures, indicating potential efficacy in skincare applications.



### 5. Viscometry



Viscometry measures the internal friction and flow characteristics of lipids in the mixtures, necessary for texture assessment in cosmetic products.
