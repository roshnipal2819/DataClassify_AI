## Results and Discussion



### Table 1: Conductivity and pH Measurements



| Sample No. | Instrument | Sample Components          | Result   | Units |

|------------|------------|----------------------------|----------|-------|

| 1          | CM-215     | Jojoba Oil, Glycerin       | 1500     | µS/cm |

| 2          | PH-700     | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol  | 7        | pH   |



**Observation**: The conductivity of the Jojoba Oil-Glycerin mixture indicates significant ionic presence. The pH value of Almond Oil and Cetyl Alcohol mixture is neutral, reflecting a balanced acidity.

| Sample No. | Instrument | Sample Components        | Result | Units  |

|------------|------------|--------------------------|--------|--------|

| 3          | IC-2100    | Coconut Oil, Vitamin E   | 0.05   | mM     |

| 4          | LC-400     | Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E    | 200    | µg/mL  |

| 5          | UV-2600    | Almond Oil, Vitamin E    | 2.2    | Abs    |



**Chosen Point**: Notably, liquid chromatography reveals a moderate concentration of Vitamin E in the Jojoba oil mixture, while UV-Vis showed substantial absorbance for Almond Oil and Vitamin E.
