### Experimental Setup



The samples analyzed were various combinations of oils and additives subjected to a battery of tests using sophisticated instruments. Each sample was treated as a distinct mixture, despite containing overlapping components. The results were measured in different units relevant to each testing method. This report will present findings from tests including lubrication assessment, rheological evaluation, optical density measurement, elemental composition analysis, and molecular characterization.

### Observations and Measurements



#### 1. **Lubrication Assessment**



Using the Four Ball Tribometer (Model: FB-1000), two samples were meticulously tested for their wear scar diameter, indicating lubrication efficiency under stress.



| Instrument        | Oil Base    | Additives  | Measurement   | Unit |

|-------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|------|

| Four Ball FB-1000 | Almond Oil  | Beeswax    | 0.750         | mm   |

| Four Ball FB-1000 | Almond Oil  | Vitamin E  | 0.650         | mm   |



*During the evaluation with Beeswax, the scar diameter was notably larger compared to that with Vitamin E, suggesting varied lubrication properties based on additive composition.*



#### 2. **Rheological Properties**



Using the sophisticated Rheometer (Model: R-4500), a sample of Almond Oil with Gum was analyzed for its viscosity under specified conditions.



| Instrument        | Oil Base    | Additive   | Viscosity      | Unit |

|-------------------|-------------|------------|----------------|------|

| Rheometer R-4500  | Almond Oil  | Gum        | 150.0          | Pa-s |



*The mixture exhibited a high viscosity, indicative of potentially favorable thickening characteristics essential for certain industrial applications.*



#### 3. **Optical Density**



Assessment via the Microplate Reader (Model: MRX) offered insights into the optical properties of Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E.



| Instrument        | Oil Base    | Additive   | Optical Density | Unit |

|-------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|------|

| Microplate Reader MRX | Jojoba Oil | Vitamin E | 2.8            | OD   |



*The oil blend demonstrated significant light absorption, correlating with specific wavelength interactions typical of enhanced visual or protective qualities.*

### Results and Analysis



#### 4. **Gas Chromatography**



A detailed evaluation was performed using the Gas Chromatograph (Model: GC-2010) on a sample composed solely of Coconut Oil.



| Instrument        | Oil Base    | Elemental Measurement | Unit |

|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------|------|

| Gas Chromatograph GC-2010 | Coconut Oil | 300.5               | ppm  |



*The presence of certain volatiles was quantified, highlighting the richness in trace compounds pivotal for fragrance or flavor profiling.*



#### 5. **Molecular Characterization**



NMR analysis provided insights into the hydrogen environment within the molecular structure of Coconut Oil with Glycerin.



| Instrument        | Oil Base    | Additive   | Measurement | Unit |

|-------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------|

| NMR Spectrometer NMR-500 | Coconut Oil | Glycerin | 10          | ppm  |



*The data hinted at significant interactions between the oil and glycerin, possibly resulting in unique relaxation dynamics beneficial for certain formulations.*

### Additional Observations



#### Viscosity Measurements with a Viscometer:



| Instrument        | Oil Base    | Additive       | Viscosity    | Unit |

|-------------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|------|

| Viscometer VS-300 | Jojoba Oil  | Vitamin E      | 2472.81      | cP   |

| Viscometer VS-300 | Jojoba Oil  | Gum            | 1934.39      | cP   |



*These assessments indicated distinct rheological behaviors, with implications for product stability in various environmental conditions.*

### Conclusion



In conclusion, the experimental series on these diverse oil mixtures revealed considerable variability in their physical and chemical properties. Factors such as additive type and concentration heavily influenced the lubrication behavior, viscosity, and molecular interactions. This nuanced understanding is critical for tailoring formulations to specific industrial applications, enhancing efficiency, performance, and sensory attributes.
