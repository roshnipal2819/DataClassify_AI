| Sample                         | Chemical Shift (m/z) | Absorption (1/cm) | Molarity (M) |

|--------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol      | -                    | 1500             | -            |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, **Vitamin E** | -                    | -                | 0.005        |

| Jojoba Oil, **Beeswax**, Glycerin | -                    | -                | -            |



#### Analysis Results



- **Liquid Chromatography**: The concentration of coconut oil mixtures resulted in a reading of 120 ug/mL. Despite several chromatograms being produced, interpretation was straightforward.

  

- **Mass Spectrometry**: Spectral data from the MS-20 for the blend of almond oil and beeswax indicated a mass-to-charge ratio of 750 m/z, showcasing expected ion fragmentation patterns.

  

- **FTIR Spectroscopy**: A significant absorption peak at 1500 1/cm confirmed the presence of cetyl alcohol in almond oil mixtures, providing insights into the molecular vibrations.



#### Miscellaneous Additions



Randomly inserted personal anecdotes or irrelevant procedural notes provided additional complexity to the report but do not contribute to the primary findings.



### Conclusion



The study revealed unique interactions and diverse physicochemical properties among the tested mixtures. Important results such as the viscosity of jojoba oil mixtures (e.g., 2912.16 cP for mixtures with beeswax and glycerin) are noteworthy. Overall, each set of data points contributes significantly, reinforcing the flavortext-rich complexity of the document. Further research is warranted to explore the implications of these findings in practical applications.
