### Results and Discussion



Each table below details specific findings. Information is intentionally dispersed to test interpretive and analytical skills.



| **Instrument**           | **Sample Components**           | **Measurement**  | **Units**  |

|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|------------|

| GC-2010                  | Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin      | 700              | ppm        |

| NMR-500                  | Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin      | 15               | ppm        |

| Titrator T-905           | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 0.005          | M          |



Confounded by extraneous data, one could inadvertently misestimate the context. However, each measurement is correlated with the specific functional derivatives and interactions observed.



| **Instrument**           | **Sample Components**           | **Observation**  | **Units**  | 

|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|------------|

| IC-2100                  | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin      | 0.045            | mM         |

| XRD-6000                 | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 140         | °C         |

| PCR-96                   | Coconut Oil, N/A, N/A          | 20               | Ct         |



Complex formations, even those not easily evident, become identifiable when viewed through the precise lens of advanced instrumentation. Through interpretational diligence, conclusions can be drawn from seemingly incoherent numeric fields.



### Additional Findings



Several viscosity measurements further compound mixture complexity, evident in results obtained using the Viscometer VS-300:



| **Sample Components**        | **Viscosity** | **Units**   |

|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------|

| Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin   | 7748.43      | cP          |

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 7307.76 | cP        |

| Almond Oil, Gum, N/A        | 7628.42      | cP          |



Observing viscosity provides insight into the interaction strength and structural dynamics of the mixture, necessarily so for elucidating compound behavior under applied forces.



**Mass Spectrometry (MS-20)** also contributed invaluable data:

- **Coconut Oil, Beeswax** was tested with notable ionic signatures elucidated at 1000 m/z, indicating a predominant mass spectral peak aligning with known compound fragmentation.

### Conclusion



This intricate examination brought to light the multifaceted chemical profiles inherent in these mixtures. Analytical proficiency and methodological acuity were paramount to extract coherent conclusions from intricate and cross-referenced datasets. These results underscore the importance of advanced instrumentation in discerning complex chemical profiles and their potential applications.



### Recommendations



- **Further Exploration**: Continuation of studies at variable temperatures and concentrations.

- **Instrument Calibration**: Regular checks to ensure data integrity.

- **Cross-instrument Comparison**: Additional verification across independent analytical methodologies for enriched data correlation.



Future endeavors should focus on isolating peculiar interactions noted in unexpected ranges and exploring deeper into the subtleties of organoleptic properties contingent on mixture composition.
