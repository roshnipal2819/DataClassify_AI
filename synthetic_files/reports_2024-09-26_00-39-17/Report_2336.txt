### Experimental Observations and Measurements



#### Mixture Analysis: Coconut Oil and Beeswax



- **Ion Chromatography**: Detected ion concentration at 37.2 mM, illustrating standard solute presence within the expected range for such an emulsion.

- **Centrifugation**: Conducted at 10,500 RPM, exposing stability under high angular velocity. No noted separation within centrifugal limits, hinting at homogeneity.



#### Mixture Analysis: Jojoba Oil and Beeswax



- **Thermal Response**: Using the TC-5000, we recorded the melting/stabilization point at 67°C. This reflects the conjunction's robustness under modest heat exposure.

- **PCR Analysis**: Amplification yielded a cycle threshold (Ct) of 29, confirming minimal interference due to substrate wax content, relevant in bioactive ingredient testing.



#### Mixture Analysis: Almond Oil and Gum



- **Rheology**: Viscoelastic properties determined at 420 Pa-s, indicating a potent gel-like state conducive for adhesive applications.



#### Mixture Analysis: Coconut Oil and Gum



- **Acid-Base Analysis**: PH-700 results showed a pH of 5.6, aligning with skin-friendly formulations.

- **Viscosity Metrics**: A notable measurement of viscosity was recorded with two disparate but related figures (5020.62 cP and 4889.63 cP), pointing towards a specific concentration effect or batch variability.



#### Miscellaneous Components: Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin



- **HPLC Results**: The presence of constituents evaluated at 15.9 mg/L. Such concentration levels are vital for product formulations targeting precise moisturization impacts.



### Irrelevant Data Section



During analysis, irrelevant monitoring from external parameters like room temperature variations and random auxiliary material presence (e.g., metallic dust) were observed, though not influencing the experimental integrity significantly.
