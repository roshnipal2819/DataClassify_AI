## Lab Report: Analysis of Various Oil Mixtures  

### Report ID: 1607  



This report presents detailed findings from a series of analyses using different types of spectrometry and chromatography to assess properties of various oil-based mixtures. Each mixture was treated as a distinct test sample, with results collated and interpreted based on the measurement method employed.



### Introduction  



The study aimed to determine the characteristic absorption, optical density, chemical composition, structural diffraction, chromatographic separation, magnetic resonance, infrared spectrum, centrifugation, and viscosity of selected oil mixtures. This involved using a combination of techniques, including UV-Vis Spectrophotometry, Microplate Reading, Ion Chromatography, X-ray Diffraction, Gas Chromatography, NMR Spectrometry, and FTIR Spectrometry, coupled with Centrifuge and Viscometer readings.

### Results  



The characterization techniques provided diverse data on each oil mixture, illustrating complex interactions between different organic compounds. For instance, the Jojoba Oil mixtures indicated significant absorption and optical density shifts, reflective of the concentration and type of alcohol present. In contrast, Almond Oil notably showed varied readings under both Microplate and Centrifuge testing, suggesting the potential for unique compound stability.

### Conclusion  



Overall, the analytical results demonstrate the complexity inherent in oil-based formulations. UV-Vis Spectroscopy identified distinct absorption signatures pertinent to the specific type of oil and its additives. Meanwhile, Ion Chromatography offered quantitative insights into the ionic concentration in Jojoba and Vitamin E combinations.



Future work is necessary to further explore these complex interactions, particularly where measurement irregularities suggest unexpected reactivity or compound stability under test conditions.

### Appendix: Miscellaneous Data  

- The XRD revealed an unexpected peak at 90 C, suggesting a possible thermal artifact.

- Two different viscometer readings for the Coconut Oil and Beeswax mixture (4761.66 cP and 4794.74 cP) indicate measurement variability or sample inconsistency.



This data provides essential insight that requires thorough evaluation and consideration for any industrial application or further research endeavors.
