## Results and Discussion



### Observations



The test mixtures, created by combining oils, waxes, and other ingredients, exhibit diverse physical properties. The presence of solid matrices like beeswax impacts viscosity significantly, whereas components like glycerin influence molecular interactions discernible through spectroscopic techniques.



### Example Data Analysis



#### Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E



- **Centrifuge (X100):** A rotational speed of 10,500 RPM highlighted the phase separation extent, indicating limited solubility among certain components.

- **Thermocycler (TC-5000):** Application at 37Â°C resulted in partial melting of the wax phase, affecting the mixture's stability.



#### Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E



- **Conductivity Meter (CM-215):** Displayed a conductivity of 1500 uS/cm, suggesting moderate ionic interactions between the components.

- **FTIR Spectrometer (FTIR-8400):** Identified characteristic absorption peaks at 2500 1/cm, indicative of specific molecular bonds.



#### Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin



- **Mass Spectrometer (MS-20):** A prominent peak at 450 m/z corresponded to a major component or fragment within the mixture.

- **Viscometer (VS-300):** The viscosity was measured at 4631.17 cP, significantly high due to wax content.
