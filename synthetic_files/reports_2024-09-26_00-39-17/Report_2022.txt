# Laboratory Report: Complex Mixtures Analysis (Report_2022)



**Introduction:**



In this report, we present a comprehensive analysis of various complex mixtures using multiple analytical techniques. By employing diverse instrumentation, we aim to uncover the distinct characteristics and properties of each sample. The key goal was to evaluate constituents like Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, and Coconut Oil under different conditions.



**Methods and Materials:**



### Instrumentation and Sample Preparation:



1. **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100** was utilized to gauge ionic concentration in Jojoba Oil samples.  

   

2. Analytical evaluation of Almond Oil and its derivatives was performed with the **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**.



3. **Mass Spectrometer MS-20** was applied for examining mass-to-charge ratios in mixtures including Jojoba Oil and Glycerin.

| Mass Spectrometer MS-20   | Jojoba Oil     | Glycerin              | 1200              | m/z     |

| Thermocycler TC-5000      | Coconut Oil    | Beeswax               | 55                | C       |



**Results and Observations:**



1. **Ionic Concentration in Jojoba Oil:**  

The results indicate a moderate ionic concentration of 10.5 mM, suggesting potential applications in formulations requiring specific ionic strengths.



2. **Almond Oil Complexity:**  

The combination of Almond Oil with Beeswax and Vitamin E exhibited a concentration of 250.3 ug/mL. Such a high concentration is indicative of pronounced synergistic effects between constituents.



3. **Mass Analysis of Jojoba Oil with Glycerin:**  

A significant m/z value of 1200 was observed, demonstrating the mixture's suitability in sectors leveraging high mass-to-charge proportions.

| Instrument               | Primary Sample | Additional Components | Measurement | Units  |

|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------|

| Thermocycler TC-5000     | Coconut Oil    | Beeswax               | 55          | C      |

| Microplate Reader MRX    | Coconut Oil    | -                     | 3.2         | OD     |

| Spectrometer Alpha-300   | Almond Oil     | -                     | 550         | nm     |

| PCR Machine PCR-96       | Almond Oil     | Gum, Vitamin E        | 25          | Ct     |



### Irrelevant Data:



It is fascinating to note the unexpected floating-point handling of spectrometer readings, and how historical parallels can be drawn from technical evolutions that mirror the rise of analogous technologies from ancients, such as Egyptian alchemy practices.



**Discussions and Implications:**



1. *Viscosity Analysis:*  

The viscosity of Almond Oil mixtures presented variations. Tests with Beeswax and Vitamin E yielded a viscosity of 7214.72 cP, as recorded with **Viscometer VS-300**. The variable presence of Vitamin E caused slight deviations in viscosity data, highlighting sensitive interactions at a molecular level that challenge viscosity predictions in mixed media.



2. *Conductivity Analysis:*  

With a **Conductivity Meter CM-215**, the Almond Oil's combination achieved 1500 uS/cm. This suggests its potential use in electrical componentry where high conductivity is desired.



3. *pH Analysis of Jojoba Oil and Glycerin:*  

The accurate pH evaluation showed a neutral environment (7.4 pH), crucial for applications necessitating minimal acidity or alkalinity.



**Conclusion:**



The intricate characteristics of each tested mixture reveal a wealth of opportunities across industrial and cosmetic applications. The data, enriched with various analytical techniques, sheds light on each compound's potential functionality. Future studies should focus on refining these analyses, recognizing obscure data correlations, and advancing the methodologies to streamline operational applications.



This report encapsulates the multi-dimensional approach and diverse analyses conducted, providing a robust platform for further exploration of sample-specific uses.
