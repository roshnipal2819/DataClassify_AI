### 2. **Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E**



The PCR Machine PCR-96 yielded a Ct value of **25**, an irrelevant information figure.



The Mass Spectrometer MS-20 detected a molecular ion peak at **1200 m/z**, indicating the presence of larger molecular species.



Viscosity, assessed by the Viscometer VS-300, was recorded at **2083.5 cP**, demonstrating moderate viscous behavior.



#### Table 2: Measurements for Jojoba Oil Mixture



| Instrument           | Measurement | Unit |

|----------------------|-------------|------|

| PCR Machine          | 25          | Ct   |

| Mass Spectrometer    | 1200        | m/z  |

| Viscometer           | 2083.5      | cP   |



The pH Meter PH-700 determined the mixture's pH to be **6.8**, implying weak acidity.



### 3. **Almond Oil, Beeswax**



Using the X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000, the crystallinity temperature was observed at **75.5°C**, hinting at a moderate crystallization behavior.



The Conductivity Meter CM-215 measured conductivity at **550 uS/cm**, demonstrating reasonable ionic mobility within the sample.



Viscosity was significantly higher, as per Viscometer VS-300, at **7158.08 cP**.

## Results and Discussion



The comprehensive evaluation of these mixtures has enabled a valuable assessment of their physical and chemical characteristics. Variations among the oil mixtures, as evident in their viscosity, molarity, and concentration, offer insight into their potential applications in cosmetic formulations.



- **Coconut Oil Mixture:** Indicated broad solute stability and moderate transparency - suitable for formulations needing a balance of opacity and nutrient presence.



- **Jojoba Oil Mixture:** Highlighted its moderate viscosity and unique molecular composition, making it favorable for more structured applications.



- **Almond Oil Mixture:** Exhibited high viscosity and crystallinity, suggesting its utility in formulations requiring texture stability.



The findings are integral for customizing cosmetics based on desired characteristics.
