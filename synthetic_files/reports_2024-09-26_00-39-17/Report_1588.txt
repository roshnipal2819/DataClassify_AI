| Instrument                        | Mixture                      | Property                       | Value     | Unit      |

|----------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|

| Rheometer R-4500                 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax         | Viscosity                      | 850       | Pa-s      |

| Microplate Reader MRX            | Almond Oil, Glycerin         | Optical Density                | 2.8       | OD        |



(Note: The typical viscosity range for coconut oil blends is significantly altered due to the presence of beeswax, showing the influence of solid particulates on fluid behavior.)  



**[Irrelevant Information]: The process of rheological evaluation often requires the careful calibration of devices, ensuring that magnetic interference due to environmental factors is minimized. Moreover, the optical parameters are sensitive to the light intensity fluctuations requiring repetition of tests multiple times for consistency.**

**Viscosity Analysis Overview (Viscometer VS-300):**



- **Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol:** 2625.81 cP

- **Coconut Oil, Vitamin E:** 4922.8 cP



These values underscore the pronounced viscosity alteration imparted by the addition of Vitamin E and other waxy agents within these blends.



### Conclusion  



The experiments detailed in this report indicate a wide variance in both the physical and chemical properties of the mixtures tested. Key observations include the increased viscosity with the inclusion of waxy substances and the notable optical density changes in oil-glycerin compositions. The mass spectrometry results offer insight into the complex molecular interactions at play. Understanding these fundamental properties can substantially advance the application of such compounds within industrial formulations.



This multifaceted analysis underscores the importance of diversified analytical techniques in providing a comprehensive understanding of complex material interactions. Future studies may expand upon these findings to optimize formulations for specific applications in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors.
