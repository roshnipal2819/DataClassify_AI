## Conclusion



This experiment highlighted the complex interrelations among different oils and additives on their thermal, spectroscopic, rheological, ionic, molecular, and viscous properties. Overlapping ranges, such as those seen in spectrophotometry and mass spectrometry, imply a possible cross-impact between underlying chemical structures and environmental conditions. Notably, the presence of gums and waxes predominantly affected viscosity and stability, whereas Vitamin E seemed to enhance elasticity.



Additional random notes not directly related to the main research suggest further exploration into the long-term stability and bioactive properties of these formulations under varying environmental conditions. These findings are set to be part of ongoing research initiatives.
