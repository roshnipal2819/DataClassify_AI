- **Viscometer (VS-300)**



Each mixture was formulated with distinct components and undergoes testing to ascertain specific properties as described below.



### Observations and Measurements



#### Table 1: Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Data



| Test ID | Instrument   | Ingredients                  | Measurement | Unit    |

|---------|--------------|------------------------------|-------------|---------|

| 976-a   | GC-2010      | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin  | 235         | ppm     |

| 976-b   | MS-20        | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 855         | m/z     |



- *Observation:* The GC analysis highlighted a significant retention of components, especially Beeswax, in ppm levels. The mass spectrometry results indicated a major ion peak for the Jojoba Oil and Cetyl Alcohol mixture, aligning with m/z values suggesting complex molecular structures.

| Test ID | Instrument   | Ingredients                | Measurement | Unit      |

|---------|--------------|----------------------------|-------------|-----------|

| 976-c   | T-905        | Jojoba Oil, Glycerin       | 0.003       | M         |

| 976-d   | FTIR-8400    | Coconut Oil, Vitamin E     | 1500        | 1/cm      |

| 976-e   | CM-215       | Coconut Oil, Gum, Glycerin | 1200        | uS/cm     |



- *Observation:* Jojoba Oil and Glycerin displayed a remarkably low molarity, indicating minor interaction in the solution state. The FTIR spectra confirmed Vibrational stretching of Coconut Oil's associated bonds. Meanwhile, a pronounced conductivity was recorded for the solution containing Gum and Glycerin, with measured conductivity showing significant ionic activity.

| Test ID | Instrument   | Ingredients                  | Measurement | Unit  |

|---------|--------------|------------------------------|-------------|-------|

| 976-f   | FB-1000      | Jojoba Oil, Gum              | 0.500       | mm    |

| 976-g   | VS-300       | Almond Oil                   | 7573.42     | cP    |

| 976-h   | VS-300       | Jojoba Oil, Gum              | 1827.43     | cP    |

| 976-i   | VS-300       | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 7366.15     | cP    |



- *Observation:* Tribological analysis via Four Ball testing demonstrated moderate wear scar formation for the mixture of Jojoba Oil and Gum. Rheological measurements revealed substantial viscosity differences; Almond Oil showed characteristically higher viscosities compared to mixtures containing Jojoba Oil or Cetyl Alcohol.



### Results and Discussion



The results illustrate diverse chemical and physical behaviors across different mixtures. Key outcomes included:



- **Retention and interaction levels:** The Gas Chromatograph data indicated significant compound retention, particularly with Beeswax in Jojoba Oil combinations. In contrast, the Mass Spectrometry readings mapped extensive ion peaks with a complex molecular character seen in Jojoba Oil and Cetyl Alcohol combinations.



- **Conductivity insights:** The mixture involving Coconut Oil and Gum exhibited pronounced electrical conductivity, suggesting potential for ionic interactions significantly enhanced by Glycerin's polarizing effects.



- **Viscosity and tribology:** Substantial differences were observed in rheological properties; Almond Oil's elevated viscosity hinted toward enhanced molecular cohesion or structural integrity compared to other tested oils.



In conclusion, this comprehensive analytical exploration offered insights into how each ingredient interacts within mixtures and contributes to the overall functional properties. Reflecting on measurement scatter and other observations, further testing could illuminate additional nuances of component interactions.

### Miscellaneous Data and Notes



While parsing through measurements and observations, it's worthwhile noting an unrelated observation: outside temperature and humidity potentially influenced data of this report, providing context that can impact interpretation.



Moreover, noise in the spectrometer readings was minimized using standard procedural calibrations, although irrelevant readings on ambient environmental emissions were noted.



These random inclusions and external interferences were considered marginally relevant amidst the broader scope of this analysis, yet they may serve as reference points or controls in future evaluations.

The compiled findings underscore the criticality of interdisciplinary approaches in evaluating such complex chemical systems, here primarily driven by their intrinsic component synergies and reactivity profiles.
