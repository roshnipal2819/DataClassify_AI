### Table 1: Optical and Chemical Testing



| Sample ID | Equipment                       | Mixture Components           | Measurement Type | Value | Unit |

|-----------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|-------|------|

| 1         | Spectrometer Alpha-300          | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax          | Wavelength       | 450   | nm   |

| 2         | Gas Chromatograph GC-2010       | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax          | Concentration    | 15    | ppm  |

| 3         | Microplate Reader MRX           | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol    | Optical Density  | 3.2   | OD   |

| 4         | NMR Spectrometer NMR-500        | Coconut Oil, Glycerin        | Chemical Shift   | 5     | ppm  |



Note: Such instruments were crucial for analyzing the optical properties and chemical constituents, providing vital insights into the mixture behaviors.



## Random Anecdote



During the testing phase, a routine maintenance issue with the Spectrometer Alpha-300 skewed initial results, but this was rectified with the intervention of senior laboratory staff.



### Table 2: Mechanical and Thermal Testing



| Sample ID | Equipment                   | Mixture Components                  | Measurement Type  | Value   | Unit  |

| 5         | Centrifuge X100             | Coconut Oil, Glycerin               | Speed             | 12000   | RPM   |

| 6         | Four Ball Tester FB-1000    | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | Wear Scar         | 0.650   | mm    |

| 7         | Thermocycler TC-5000        | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin      | Temperature       | 47      | Â°C    |

| 8         | PCR Machine PCR-96          | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin      | Cycle Threshold   | 25      | Ct    |

| 9         | Viscometer VS-300           | Almond Oil, Gum                     | Viscosity         | 7741.49 | cP    |



The readings from Table 2 illustrate the mechanical resilience and the thermal profile of various combinations. For instance, the high viscosity of the Almond Oil-Gum mixture indicates its potential use in thickening applications.
