## Observations



The data gathered indicated that each combination of components exhibited unique physical and chemical properties. Samples containing gummy substances, such as Sample A, exhibited relatively neutral pH, while wear-resistant qualities were more pronounced in samples with added vitamin E (e.g., Sample B). High viscosity was noted in Sample I, suggesting a potential interaction between almond oil and gum that affects flow properties.



## Conclusion



This experimental analysis concludes that the different mixtures display a wide array of properties depending on their composition. Instruments such as the pH Meter PH-700, Four Ball Wear Tester FB-1000, and others played critical roles in characterizing these properties. However, discrepancies in certain sample behaviors should be further investigated for more comprehensive understanding.
