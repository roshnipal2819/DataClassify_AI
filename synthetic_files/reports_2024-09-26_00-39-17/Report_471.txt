## Title: Analytical Assessment of Oil-Based Mixtures



### Project ID: Report_471



#### Introduction



In the conducted experiments, oil-based mixtures were analyzed using various analytical techniques to determine their properties and composition. These mixtures include combinations of oils with other substances such as Glycerin, Beeswax, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E. The aim was to provide a comprehensive analysis of these mixtures, examining their chemical structure, light absorption properties, acidity, conductivity, and molecular composition.



### Materials and Methods



Various instruments with distinct capabilities were utilized to scrutinize the test samples. The UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, X-Ray Diffractometer, FTIR Spectrometer, and others were instrumental in providing a broad characterization of each mixture.

### Irrelevant Details



**Random Notes**: While executing the tests, it was observed that the room temperature fluctuated between 20-23 °C, which might have subtly influenced the viscosity readings of the oils. It's crucial to mention that last weekend's football game had no measurable impact on the experiments conducted during this week. Likewise, the color of the lab technician’s attire, an interesting patterned shirt, had no significant correlation with the outcome of the tests.

#### Results and Discussions



The analyses reveal substantial insights into the chemical compositions and interactions within the mixtures:



1. **UV-Vis Spectroscopy** indicated that Jojoba Oil has a visible absorption peak, confirming components' purity and potential chromophores.



2. **X-Ray Diffraction** evidenced crystalline structures in Almond Oil at elevated temperatures; it's hypothesized that this may relate to specific fatty acid crystallization.



3. **FTIR Spectroscopy** provided clear evidence of hydroxyl groups in the Coconut Oil and Glycerin mixture, essential for understanding potential hydrogen bonding networks.



4. A pH measurement of **6.8** for Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E reveals a largely neutral mixture, aligning with expected values for skincare formulations.



5. **Conductivity** was higher than anticipated in Almond Oil and Beeswax, possibly due to dissolved ions from Beeswax.



6. **Titration** of Jojoba Oil confirmed a low molarity, consistent with the oil's non-polar nature.



7. **Liquid Chromatography** successfully isolated Vitamin E in Almond Oil and Gum mixture, allowing for precise content dosage.



8. **Ion Chromatography** validated the concentration of ions, emphasizing the consistent glycerin peak retention post-test.



9. The **Four Ball Wear Test** demonstrated a moderate wear scar, indicative of the lubricant properties of the combined Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin mixture.
