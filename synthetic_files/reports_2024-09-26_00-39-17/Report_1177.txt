# Laboratory Report: Report_1177



## Introduction



This report details the comprehensive analysis of various mixtures using multiple instruments. Each unique combination of ingredients represents a test sample subjected to specific analytical techniques.



### Objective



To evaluate the physical and chemical properties of mixtures containing Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Beeswax, Glycerin, Gum, and Vitamin E utilizing diverse analytical methodologies.



## Materials and Methods



### Instruments and Samples



- **Mass Spectrometer MS-20**

- **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**

- **Spectrometer Alpha-300**

- **PCR Machine PCR-96**

- **Titrator T-905**

- **Thermocycler TC-5000**

- **Microplate Reader MRX**

- **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600**

- **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000**

- **Viscometer VS-300**



Four sample mixtures were analyzed:

1. Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin

2. Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E

3. Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin

4. Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E



### Random Observations



During handling, the texture of each mixture was distinctly different. Interestingly, Sample 3 had a noticeable pear-like scent. The room temperature was maintained at 21.7°C, although one corner of the lab had fluctuating humidity levels, which might affect sample viscosity. The equipment displayed varying degrees of operational noise.



### Measurements and Results



**Table 1: Mass Spectrometry Analysis**



| Sample Components         | Instrument             | Key Measurement | Unit   |

|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------|

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | Mass Spectrometer MS-20  | 658.7           | m/z    |



**Table 2: Liquid Chromatography Results**



| Sample Components         | Device                         | Measurement | Unit   |

|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|--------|

| Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 | 125.3       | ug/mL  |



**Table 3: Spectroscopy and UV-Vis Readings**



| Sample Components | Spectroscopy Device   | Measurement | Wavelength/Absorbance |

|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------|

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol  | Spectrometer Alpha-300 | 365.0       | nm                    |

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol  | UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600 | 1.7         | Abs                   |



In this section, please ignore the irrelevant visual distortion affecting the display coordinates. Note that the slightly opaque optical path of the spectrometer might cause occasional spikes in readouts.



**Table 4: PCR and Thermocycling Data**



| Sample Components         | Machine                     | Measurement | Unit |

|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|------|

| Jojoba Oil, Glycerin      | PCR Machine PCR-96          | 25.8        | Ct   |

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | Thermocycler TC-5000       | 45.3        | °C  |



**Chemical Titration**



Using the Titrator T-905, the molarity of the Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E mixture was determined to be **0.575 M**. However, checkerboard pattern readings on the display panel might imply an interference due to unfiltered lighting.



**Viscosity Measurements**



| Sample Components | Instrument     | Viscosity  | Unit |

|-------------------|----------------|------------|------|

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | Viscometer VS-300 | 2947.0     | cP   |

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | Viscometer VS-300 | 2791.94 | cP   |



**X-Ray Diffraction**



A crucial parameter for determining crystallinity in oily substrates, the Jojoba Oil, Glycerin mixture was analyzed using the X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000, yielding a notable peak at **78.5°C**.



## Discussion



The viscosity discrepancies between Samples 1 and 3 could result from the higher melting point of Beeswax. The m/z ratio identified via mass spectrometry suggests a possible contamination, although further elution phase tests are required. Additionally, strange calibration offsets in UV readings highlight the necessity for equipment recalibration.



## Conclusion



This analytical review underlines the importance of holistic evaluation across various techniques to better understand the multi-faceted properties of ingredient mixtures.



## Appendix



Please disregard spurious data points around threshold limits unless specified otherwise. Always validate with the original chromatograph curves.
