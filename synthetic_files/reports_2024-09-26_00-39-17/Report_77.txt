| Sample ID   | Instrument                    | Composition                        | Value | Unit  |

|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|-------|

| Report_77_6 | NMR Spectrometer NMR-500      | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin      | 10    | ppm   |

| Report_77_7 | pH Meter PH-700               | Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E        | 6.5   | pH    |



#### Detailed Description



- **NMR Spectroscopy:** Measurement at 10 ppm illustrates distinctive proton environments in the composition, crucial for evaluating hydrogen bonding in the matrix.

  

- **pH Evaluation:** A pH of 6.5 suggests a balanced feature suitable for maintaining skin's natural barrier.



## Discussion



The results underscore the diverse physicochemical properties inherent to each mixture. The high viscosity and absorbance of Jojoba Oil blends indicate their efficacy in thickening and UV-sensitive formulations. 



Conversely, Coconut Oil-based samples presented superior flow resistance and a neutral pH favorable for conditioner bases. An incidental observation of mass spectrometric data suggested "950 m/z" for Almond Oil/Beeswax, pointing to complex molecular weights involved.



## Conclusion



The assessment of these formulations provides a framework for further optimization in cosmetic development. Future studies will explore cross-modality interactions and long-term stability tests to refine product efficiency.
