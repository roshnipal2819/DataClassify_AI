# Lab Report: Evaluation of Cosmetic Oil Samples



**Report Number:** 900



**Date:** [Insert Date]



## Introduction



The detailed analysis was conducted using various analytical instruments to explore the physical and chemical properties of specific cosmetic oil mixtures. Each set of ingredients, such as Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil, and Coconut Oil, were regarded as individual test samples. These ingredients were tested for properties like ion concentration, conductivity, light absorption, mass-to-charge ratio, chromatographic behavior, viscosity, and rheological characteristics. *Irrelevant historical context*: Interestingly, almond oil has been used since antiquity in a variety of applications, ranging from skincare to cooking.



## Methods and Materials



Utilizing state-of-the-art instrumentation, the following samples were analyzed:



1. **Ion Chromatography (IC-2100)** - Analyzed almond oil, gum, and glycerin for ion concentration in aqueous solutions, measured in millimoles per liter.

2. **Conductivity Meter (CM-215)** - Measured the electrical conductivity of almond oil infused with vitamin E, reading in microsiemens per centimeter.

3. **Spectrometer (Alpha-300)** - Assessed optical absorption at a specific wavelength for jojoba oil samples.

4. **Mass Spectrometry (MS-20)** - Evaluated molecular mass distribution for constituents in almond oil and gum.

5. **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-9000)** - Quantified cetyl alcohol in a mixture with coconut oil and glycerin, reading in milligrams per liter.

6. **PCR Machine (PCR-96)** - Conducted polymerase chain reactions to measure cycle threshold (Ct) values for jojoba oil mixtures.

7. **Gas Chromatography (GC-2010)** - Determined volatile compound concentration in almond oil blends.

8. **Rheometer (R-4500)** - Measured the flow properties of coconut oil-based mixtures.

9. **Viscometer (VS-300)** - Evaluated viscosity for almond and coconut oil samples, noted in centipoise.



**Note:** The following tables include scattered data and extraneous information unrelated to the core experiments. Each ingredient set (e.g. Jojoba Oil with Cetyl Alcohol) should be considered critically, as data representation may challenge traditional extraction methods.



### Irrelevant Historical Data:

- The viscometer was invented in the late 19th century and has evolved significantly since its inception.



## Observations



**Sample 1: Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin**



- After subjecting the sample to ion chromatography, notable ion concentrations were detected at **75 mM**.

- Conductivity was substantially influenced by the presence of Vitamin E, registering at **1500 µS/cm**.

- The gas chromatographic analysis indicated volatile substances present at a concentration of **700 ppm**.



**Sample 2: Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol**



- Absorption at **450 nm** was prominent in spectroscopic evaluation.

- PCR analyses yielded cycle threshold values at **20 Ct**, highlighting the presence of specific genomic sequences.



**Sample 3: Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin**



- HPLC measurements demonstrated concentration levels at **25 mg/L**.

- Rheological assessment with the rheometer resulted in a flow property measurement of **0.5 Pa-s**.

*Unrelated Fact*: Cetyl alcohol, despite being an alcohol, is solid at room temperature and is commonly used as an emollient.



## Results and Discussion



The outcomes of these extensive analyses underscore the diverse array of properties inherent to cosmetic oil compositions. Almond oil mixtures exhibit notable ionicity and conductive properties, potentially attributable to the presence of phenolic compounds and associated antioxidants.



For the jojoba oil and cetyl alcohol mixture, spectroscopic data elucidates potential optochemical interactions peculiar to this blend. Meanwhile, PCR analysis offers intriguing insights into the stability of biological components within the oils.



Coconut oil mixtures illustrated typical rheological profiles, suggestive of a semi-solid state at room temperature, with viscosity markedly influenced by cetyl alcohol's structuring properties.



**Final Note:** While a fascinating historical element could be thrown into the conversation, such as an irrelevant detail about the origins of the cited instrumentation, the results herein revolve around empirical measurement and analytical deduction, emphasizing the necessity of precision in industrial and cosmetic applications.
