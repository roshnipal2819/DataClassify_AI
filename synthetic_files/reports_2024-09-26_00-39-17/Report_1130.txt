## Results



The results revealed unique characteristics for each mixture, underscoring the influence of individual ingredients. Variability in measurements across different instruments indicates complexity inherent in understanding molecular interactions.



- **Complex spectra and absorbance peaks** suggested diverse interactions and structural variations.

- **Titration molarity** values pointed to differential reactivity, particularly for Vitamin E in varied systems.

- **Viscosity analysis** highlighted significant differences among samples, especially the impact of Cetyl Alcohol and Glycerin within the viscosity parameters.



**Random Observation**: The presence of Cetyl Alcohol in any mixture exhibited interesting effects on its viscosity and spectral absorption, which might imply underlying chemical interactions affecting these parameters.

## Conclusion



The comprehensive analysis using multiple technologies provided a holistic view of the samples' chemical makeup. Understanding these variations can have practical implications in product development and quality control, particularly for industries focusing on personal care products. Further analysis focusing on stability and shelf-life prediction might also prove valuable.
