### Introduction



The study of oil mixtures and their properties is a critical area in both academic research and industrial applications. By combining oils with various substances such as gums, alcohols, and vitamins, novel compounds with enhanced properties can be developed. 



Observations from these mixtures can indicate possible synergistic effects contributing to stability or performance, particularly in cosmetology and therapeutic products. The selection of instruments for this analysis was based on their ability to reveal different facets of the samples, ranging from molecular composition to physical stability characteristics.

### Methodology



An array of modern analytical instruments was utilized to cover a broad spectrum of measurement goals:



1. **Centrifuge X100**: Employed to estimate the stability of the oil mixtures by simulating gravity under high rotations per minute. Specifically, this method helps identify layering tendencies in multi-phase systems.



2. **FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400**: Utilized to elucidate the molecular fingerprints of the oil mixtures. Vibrational spectroscopy highlights functional groups and bonding structures within the samples.



3. **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000**: Enabled the determination of crystalline structures, particularly in mixtures like Coconut Oil with Cetyl Alcohol, which may form semi-crystalline networks.



4. **Conductivity Meter CM-215**: Applied for assessing ionic conductivity within the emulsions, indicative of potential electrolytic behavior.



5. **PCR Machine PCR-96**: Though traditionally used in genetic applications, here it determines thermocycling stability of mixtures like Almond Oil with Cetyl Alcohol.



6. **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**: High sensitivity analysis for component quantification, especially useful for detecting trace components.



7. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**: Provided in-depth chemical environment descriptions, focusing on hydrogen environments to map molecular conformations.



8. **HPLC System HPLC-9000**: Utilized for the separation of compounds providing quantitative data regarding component concentrations.

### Discussion



The results portray diverse chemical and physical behaviors across the different mixtures when subjected to varied analytic methodologies. The combination of oils with specific compounds can significantly influence their structural and functional efficacy. For instance, Glycerin's presence seems to enhance emulsification stability across multiple samples.



The unique properties discerned from NMR and FTIR analyses further suggest molecular alignment changes that could impact viscosity and transparency, rewarding ongoing exploration for tailored applications in cosmetic fluids and ointments.



Random non-related observation: The atmospheric pressure during the days of analysis fluctuated drastically, albeit having no discernible influence on the collected data; however, it's a factor worth recording for completeness.
