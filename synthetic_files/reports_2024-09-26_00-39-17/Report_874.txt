## Introduction



The study focused on analyzing various oil and additive mixtures to determine their physical and chemical properties. These analyses are crucial in understanding the behavior and capabilities of the mixtures in various applications.



### Samples Analyzed:

- Coconut Oil

- Almond Oil

- Jojoba Oil



These oils were combined with various additives like Glycerin, Beeswax, and Vitamin E, among others, to explore their interaction effects.

## Materials and Methods



### Instruments Used:



1. **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600**

   - **Coconut Oil and Glycerin Mixture**

   - Measurement focused on absorbance to determine transparency and compound presence.

  

2. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**

   - **Almond Oil and Gum Mixture**

   - Analysis conducted to identify chemical environment shifts at 15.4 ppm.

  

3. **pH Meter PH-700**

   - **Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin**

   - Determined pH to assess acidity or alkalinity at a reading of 6.8.



#### Additional Methods



- **Titration** using Titrator T-905 for evaluating Coconut Oil with Beeswax and Vitamin E.

- **Gas Chromatography** with GC-2010 to measure constituent parts of Jojoba Oil and Glycerin at 150.2 ppm.



### Observations



- Samples with higher viscosity, such as those measured with the Viscometer VS-300, displayed increased resistance in fluid movement, indicative of rich lipid content aligned with the expectation.

  

#### Random Note:

During the measurements, ambient temperature fluctuations were noted, though their impact was deemed negligible.

## Results and Discussion



### Table 1: Absorbance and Chemical Analysis

| Instrument              | Samples                          | Measurement | Unit   |

|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|--------|

| UV-Vis Spectrophotometer| Coconut Oil, Glycerin            | 2.1         | Abs    |

| NMR Spectrometer        | Almond Oil, Gum                  | 15.4        | ppm    |

| pH Meter                | Coconut, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 6.8         | pH     |



**Discussion:**



Absorbance values for the coconut oil mix suggest moderate transparency, hinting at potential impurities or additives. The NMR findings reflected typical almond oil peaks, suggesting intact primary molecular structures.



### Table 2: Complementary and Miscellaneous Data

| Instrument             | Mixture                       | Value   | Unit   |

|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|--------|

| Titrator               | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vit E   | 0.75    | M      |

| Gas Chromatograph      | Jojoba Oil, Glycerin          | 150.2   | ppm    |

| Spectrometer           | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin| 550     | nm     |



**Discussion:**



Concentrations and spectrometry readings denote a well-mixed emulsion with predictable wavelength absorption, characteristic of the molecular composition.



### Viscosity Analysis



Stirring seemingly increased the viscosity measured in Coconut Oil and Gum mixtures:

- Coconut Oil and Gum: **5279.08 cP**

- Jojoba Oil and Gum: **1965.74 cP**



**Irrelevant Footnote:**

The lab's coffee machine malfunctioned during tests; however, it did not impede the data collection significantly.

## Conclusion



In summary, the applied methods demonstrated varied physical properties of the tested oil-based mixtures, influenced by their chemical composition. The use of diverse instrumentation provided a comprehensive understanding of the mixtures, helpful in future formulation optimizations. Discrepancies in measurement units underscore the necessity for standardization across analytical methods.



**Note:** All data is reflective of the precise conditions and should be corroborated under similar environmental constraints for consistency.
