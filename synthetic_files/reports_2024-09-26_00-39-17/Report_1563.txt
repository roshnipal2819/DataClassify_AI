### Apparatus and Methods



The following instruments were employed:



1. **Mass Spectrometer (MS-20)**

2. **Titrator (T-905)**

3. **Gas Chromatograph (GC-2010)**

4. **PCR Machine (PCR-96)**

5. **X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD-6000)**

6. **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (UV-2600)**

7. **Viscometer (VS-300)**



### Results and Discussion



#### Mass Spectrometry Analysis



Mass Spectrometry (MS) was employed to ascertain the mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of ingredient mixtures:



| Sample ID | Ingredients                       | Instrument    | Result (m/z) |

|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------------|--------------|

| A         | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E    | MS-20         | 1890         |

| B         | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E    | MS-20         | 920          |



Description: The **high m/z ratio** for Jojoba Oil and Beeswax indicates the presence of large molecular fragments, suggesting a complex structural framework inherent in these components.



#### Gas Chromatography Analysis



Gas Chromatography (GC) was used to determine the concentration of volatile compounds:



| Sample ID | Ingredients                        | Instrument   | Concentration (ppm) |

|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|

| C         | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax               | GC-2010      | 145                 |

| D         | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E   | GC-2010      | 305                 |



Observation: The substantial difference in concentration between Jojoba Oil and Coconut Oil blends possibly points towards higher volatile components in **coconut-based mixtures**.



#### Titration Results



Employed to measure molarity (M) of active compounds:



| Sample ID | Ingredients                       | Instrument   | Molarity (M) |

|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|

| E         | Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E        | T-905         | 5.673        |

| F         | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E        | T-905         | 8.429        |



Insight: A higher **molarity in Jojoba Oil mixtures** suggests greater solubility or interaction of Vitamin E with the other components.



#### PCR and X-Ray Diffraction



PCR quantification (Ct) and crystallography:



| Sample ID | Ingredients                       | Instrument   | Ct/C Temp (C) |

|-----------|-----------------------------------|-------------|--------------|

| G         | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E    | PCR-96      | 32 Ct       |

| H         | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | XRD-6000 | 150 C       |

| I         | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax               | PCR-96      | 29 Ct       |



Exposition: The lower Ct value in **Jojoba Oil mixtures** indicates a higher initial concentration, whereas the **X-Ray temperature** unveils the thermal stability of Almond Oil combinations. 



#### UV-Vis Spectroscopy



Absorbance measurements:



| Sample ID | Ingredients                       | Instrument   | Absorbance |

|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------|------------|

| J         | Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E       | UV-2600      | 2.45       |

| K         | Almond Oil                        | UV-2600      | 2.75       |



Commentary: **Almond Oil displays higher absorbance**, implying a denser molecular presence or increased optical activity.



#### Viscosity Measurements



Viscometry assessments for fluid dynamics:



| Sample ID | Ingredients                     | Instrument   | Viscosity (cP) |

|-----------|---------------------------------|--------------|----------------|

| L         | Coconut Oil, Vitamin E          | VS-300       | 4923.01        |

| M         | Coconut Oil                     | VS-300       | 5141.41        |

| N         | Almond Oil, Gum                 | VS-300       | 7554.89        |



Conclusion: **Almond Oil mixes with Gum** exhibit notably higher viscosity, indicating a thicker and potentially more stable emulsion compared to Coconut Oil blends.
