**Introduction:**  

The study of oil-based mixtures presents challenges due to their complex rheological and chemical properties. By employing multiple analytic techniques, including centrifugation, spectrophotometry, chromatography, and viscometry, we aim to gain insights into the behavior and composition of these mixtures.



**Materials and Methods:**  

The samples were prepared as follows:

1. **Sample Components** were systematically combined: Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, Almond Oil, Gum, Beeswax, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E.

2. Each combination was identified as a unique test sample.

3. The instruments utilized include:

   - Centrifuge X100

   - Thermocycler TC-5000

   - Microplate Reader MRX

   - Mass Spectrometer MS-20

   - UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600

   - HPLC System HPLC-9000

   - Liquid Chromatograph LC-400

   - Viscometer VS-300



**Results and Discussion:**



**Centrifugation Analysis:**

The centrifugation process was executed at varying speeds, reflecting the differing densities of the samples.



| **Sample**                         | **Ingredients**                       | **Centrifuge Speed (RPM)** |

|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|

| Sample A                           | Jojoba Oil, Gum                       | 12000                      |

| Sample B                           | Coconut Oil, Beeswax                  | 11500                      |



This high-speed separation (fluctuating above 11,000 RPM) enabled effective stratification of the lipid and aqueous phases.



**Thermal and Optical Analysis:**



| **Instrument**                       | **Ingredients**                  | **Parameters**  | **Measurement**  |

|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|

| Thermocycler TC-5000                 | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin        | Temperature     | 75°C             |

| Microplate Reader MRX                | Jojoba Oil, Glycerin             | Optical Density | 3.2 OD           |

| UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600     | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin   | Absorbance      | 2.8 Abs          |



The thermodynamic response showed significant thermal resilience at 75°C, aligning with the expected stability of jojoba and coconut oils. Optical assessments revealed moderate UV absorbance, indicative of sample purity levels.



**Chromatographic Analysis:**



| **Equipment**                     | **Composition**                | **Concentration** | **Measurement Unit** |

|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|

| HPLC System HPLC-9000             | Jojoba Oil                     | 500               | mg/L                 |

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400       | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vit E| 45                | ug/mL                |

| Mass Spectrometer MS-20           | Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E    | 1500              | m/z                  |



Notably, HPLC and LC results reflected substantial solute concentrations, crucial for comprehensive compound profiling.



**Viscometric Analysis:**



| **Sample**       | **Mixture Components**      | **Viscosity (cP)** |

|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|

| Sample C         | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 4934.5          |

| Sample D         | Coconut Oil, Glycerin                   | 4981.57         |

| Sample E         | Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E                   | 2572.33         |



Viscometric profiles unveil the elevated structural viscosity when blending oils with alcohols and vitamins, registering substantial resistance to flow.



**Conclusions:**  

The data illustrate a paradigm of consistent results across analytical methodologies, fostering an enhanced understanding of these oil-based systems. While complex interdependencies exist, the integration of high precision techniques has yielded actionable intelligence on their physicochemical behavior.
