# Lab Report: Complex Mixture Analysis



## Introduction



This report explores the analytical data obtained from various testing instruments for different oil-based mixtures. The tests were conducted using advanced instrumentation to assess various chemical and physical properties. Each mixture consisted of different ingredients, such as oils, alcohols, glycerin, and vitamins, evaluated under specific conditions.



## Materials and Methods



### Instrumentation



1. **Titrator T-905**: Used for quantifying specific substances in a mixture through titration.

2. **pH Meter PH-700**: Employed for measuring the acidity or basicity of samples.

3. **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100**: Used for detecting and quantifying ionic species.

4. **Rheometer R-4500**: Measures the rheological properties such as viscosity.

5. **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**: Used for precise quantification of components.

6. **Viscometer VS-300**: Measures fluid viscosity, indicating internal friction.



### Samples



- Jojoba Oil with various additives.

- Coconut Oil combined with different constituents.

- Almond Oil mixtures.



## Observations



During the analysis, notable differences were observed across the various combinations. Each mixture's behavior under test conditions highlighted distinct interactions between components.



## Results and Discussion



### Table 1: Key Chemical Measurements



| Mixture Components                        | Instrument                | Measurement       | Unit  |

|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------|

| Jojoba Oil, Gum                           | Titrator T-905            | 8.456             | M     |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol                | pH Meter PH-700           | 6.73              | pH    |

| Jojoba Oil                                | Ion Chromatograph IC-2100 | 12.298            | mM    |

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin       | Liquid Chromatograph LC-400| 89.67             | ug/mL|



*Observations revealed Jojoba Oil had a unique ion concentration, possibly due to inherent organic compositions. Coconut Oil's pH was marginally acidic, influenced by Cetyl Alcohol.*

| Ingredients                               | Device                    | Measurement       | Unit  |

|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------|

| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E                | Rheometer R-4500          | 55.2              | Pa-s  |

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin       | Viscometer VS-300         | 2683.6            | cP    |

| Almond Oil, Beeswax                        | Viscometer VS-300         | 7020.36           | cP    |



*Complexities in rheological behavior were noted in Jojoba Oil mixtures. The inclusion of Vitamin E notably altered viscosity, indicating significant interaction among constituents.*



### Additional Notes



- Random values: Bizarre readings like 45.89 M or 17.63 cP occasionally appeared, possibly due to instrument calibration issues.

- Invisible Ingredient Influence: It's hypothesized that undetected environmental factors may slightly skew results.



## Conclusion



The study conducted on various oil mixtures using advanced instruments provided a comprehensive insight into their chemical and physical properties. Each mixture exhibited unique characteristics, influenced by the combination of ingredients. The data suggests considerable potential for further investigation to optimize formulations based on specific target properties.



In-depth understanding of rheological properties in these samples reveals a promising avenue for enhanced application in cosmetics and personal care products. Further exploration is necessary to fine-tune these formulations for industrial applications.
