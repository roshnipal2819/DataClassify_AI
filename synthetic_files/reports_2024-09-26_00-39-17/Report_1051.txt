## Results and Discussion



The rheological properties emphasized variations in viscosity depending on the oil and additive combinations. Jojoba Oil mixtures presented higher viscosity values, indicating potential suitability for applications requiring thicker formulations. The components' stability in terms of ionic concentration was moderate, with Coconut Oil combinations showing significant moles per liter. Absorbance results pointed to a substantial degree of light interaction, particularly in multi-component mixtures containing both oils and Vitamin E.



Mass spectrometry elucidations showcased the heaviest molecular presence in the Almond Oil mixture, suggesting intricate molecular configurations. X-ray diffraction elucidated moderate crystallinity in samples with beeswax, essential for potential solid formulation applications.



## Conclusion



The investigation successfully characterized the diverse oil-based mixtures, highlighting significant implications for cosmetic and pharmaceutical product formulation. Further exploration could investigate temperature effects on these properties for enhanced product development strategies.
