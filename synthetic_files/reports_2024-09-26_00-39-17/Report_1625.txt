## Results and Analysis



The analysis of Coconut Oil and Gum using the Rheometer R-4500 revealed a viscosity of 845 Pa-s, indicating significant resistance to deformation under shear stress. The pH analysis of Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E mixture returned a value of 5.8, suggesting a slightly acidic nature conducive to topical applications.



The Mass Spectrometer MS-20 identified a mass-to-charge ratio of 875 m/z for the Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E composition, implying a specific molecular weight indicative of complex compound formation. Centrifuge tests on the Almond Oil and Beeswax mixture, optimized at 1300 RPM, demonstrated enhanced phase separation capabilities.



Conductivity readings of Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E achieved 1200 uS/cm, denoting increased ionic activity, while the X-ray diffraction revealed a crystalline phase at 85 C for Coconut Oil and Beeswaxâ€”a crucial finding for thermal stability studies.



Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy indicated mid-infrared peaks at 3200 1/cm, typical of coconut-derived molecular structures, while ion chromatography readings confirmed very low ion presence at 0.045 mM in the Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E blend.



## Conclusion



This comprehensive report offers a deep dive into the analytical profiles of various oil-based mixtures, providing insights on their rheological, chemical, and thermal behaviors. The complex interplay of ingredients was revealed through the diverse methodologies applied, shedding light on the properties of these formulations for potential commercial and pharmaceutical applications. Future studies may further refine these findings, advancing the product development field.
