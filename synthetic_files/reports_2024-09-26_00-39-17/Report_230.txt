| Test ID | Instrument    | Mixture                        | Viscosity | Unit  |

|---------|---------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-------|

| 9       | VS-300        | Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E    | 5126.41   | cP    |

| 10      | VS-300        | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | 3046.93   | cP    |

| 11      | VS-300        | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin  | 2822.44   | cP    |



## Results



In analyzing the gathered data, several trends became apparent. The viscosity of the mixtures was notably highest with coconut oil and gum as a combination, indicating a likely synergistic thickening effect. Conductivity, measured via CM-215, reflected the ionic content, with Jojoba Oil and Glycerin showing good conductivity.



### Discussion



The Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 provided specific insight into the concentrations of components in the Almond Oil mixture, highlighting the presence of Cetyl Alcohol significantly. The precise m/z ratio from the Mass Spectrometer indicated clear spectroscopic features.



Meanwhile, irrelevant metrics, such as 1450 m/z from the MS-20 for pure Almond Oil, primarily serve as baselines more than definitive analytical points due to limitations in information and specificity.



### Conclusion



This comprehensive study offers substantial evidence on the properties of various oil mixtures using diverse instrumentation. While some measurements may be deemed extraneous in specific contexts, each contributes to the broader chemical understanding. Future work should prioritize refining measurement techniques to deepen analysis precision.
