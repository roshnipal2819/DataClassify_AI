# Lab Report: Analysis of Natural Oil Mixtures  

**Report ID:** Report_1795  



## Introduction  

The objective of this study was to analyze various natural oil mixtures using different laboratory instruments. The chosen mixtures involved combinations of Almond Oil, Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, and Gum. This report presents a detailed description of the procedures, observations, and results.



## Methods and Materials  

The experiments were conducted using several high-precision instruments, as mentioned throughout this report. Test samples were prepared as specified to ensure consistency and accuracy. Each mixture was analyzed for different physical and chemical properties using established protocols.



## Observations  

Through the series of tests conducted, the following observations were made on the different mixtures:



### Table 1: Instrumental Analysis and Thermal Stability  

| Instrument                  | Ingredients                  | Observed Value | Unit |

|-----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|------|

| Thermocycler TC-5000        | Almond Oil, Beeswax          | 56.2           | °C   |

| PCR Machine PCR-96          | Almond Oil, Glycerin         | 28.4           | Ct   |



During thermal analysis with the Thermocycler TC-5000, the Almond Oil and Beeswax exhibited a stable profile at 56.2°C, indicative of their robust thermal properties. Additionally, the PCR analysis highlighted a threshold cycle (Ct) value, providing insights into the replication aspects of the mixture not germane to the experiment but useful for process understanding.



**Note:** Occasionally, during these analyses, several unrelated measurements like ambient room temperature, 23°C, were recorded but were not of consequence.



### Table 2: Spectral and Chromatographic Analysis  

| Instrument                   | Ingredients                           | Measured Value | Unit |

|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|------|

| Spectrometer Alpha-300       | Coconut Oil                           | 275            | nm   |

| Ion Chromatograph IC-2100    | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin         | 0.045          | mM   |



In the spectrometric observation at 275 nm, Coconut Oil displayed a notable absorbance peak. Meanwhile, ion chromatography of Almond Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin demonstrated a concentration of 0.045 mM, indicating effective molecular interaction.



During unrelated observations, several empty vials were labeled, but this did not impact the study's findings.



### Table 3: Titration and Molecular Spectroscopy  

| Instrument               | Ingredients                       | Measurement | Unit |

|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|------|

| Titrator T-905           | Coconut Oil, Gum, Glycerin        | 0.007       | M    |

| NMR Spectrometer NMR-500 | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 7.6         | ppm  |



Titration using the T-905 revealed a modest molarity of 0.007 M in the sample, which correlates with expected acid-base interactions. High-resolution NMR data exposed a chemical shift at 7.6 ppm, associated with specific protons in the chimera of Coconut and Cetyl Alcohol with Glycerin.



In tangential observations, unrelated solvent densities of 0.85 g/cm³ were filed.



### Table 4: Mechanical Properties and Viscosity Measurements  

| Instrument       | Ingredients                      | Viscosity    | Unit  |

|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|-------|

| Viscometer VS-300 | Almond Oil, Glycerin            | 7492.15      | cP   |

| Viscometer VS-300 | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol      | 5335.58      | cP   |

| Viscometer VS-300 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax            | 4712.5       | cP   |



Viscosity analyses on the Viscometer VS-300 exhibited definitive variations in fluidity among mixtures. Almond Oil mixed with Glycerin had the highest viscosity, suggesting synergistic thickening effects, while Coconut Oil in combination with Cetyl Alcohol and Beeswax showed relatively lower viscosity values.



It's important to note that an off-hand calibration observation, including instrument serial numbers, was mentioned, but this is not relevant to the data interpretation.



## Conclusion  

This report encompasses a plethora of physical and chemical profiles for various oil-based compositions. The multifaceted approach adopted herein reveals the intrinsic properties of natural oil mixtures, fostering deeper insights for potential applications. Though embedded with disparate data points, only relevant findings are essential for a holistic understanding of the interactions studied.
