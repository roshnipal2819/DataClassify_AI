# Lab Report: 281



## Introduction



This report details analytical assessments of various oil-based mixtures using several sophisticated laboratory instruments. The core objective was to evaluate the compositions and properties of these mixtures through techniques like Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatography (GC), Rheometry, and more. Each mixture consisted of a combination of ingredients, tested for key parameters to assess their chemical makeup and physical attributes. Below, we present a compilation of methods, observations, and measurements.



## Materials & Methods



### Instruments and Equipment



1. **FTIR Spectrometer (FTIR-8400)**: Used to assess the vibrational properties of molecular bonds within samples.

2. **Microplate Reader (MRX)**: Utilized for optical density measurement.

3. **Gas Chromatograph (GC-2010)**: Analyzed volatile components.

4. **Rheometer (R-4500)**: Measured the viscosity of the mixtures.

5. **PCR Machine (PCR-96)**: Amplified target DNA segments for comparison studies.

6. **Centrifuge (X100)**: Employed to separate components based on density.

7. **NMR Spectrometer (NMR-500)**: Provided insights into molecular structures.



### Observations



Below, we detail the observations and findings from each specific test. Various anomalies and irrelevant scattered data are included to simulate real-world complexities in analytical data reporting.



#### Table 1: FTIR Spectrometry of Almond Oil Mixtures



| Sample ID | Mixture Components     | Wavenumber (1/cm) | Comments      |

|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|

| FTIR-001  | Almond Oil, Glycerin   | 3200              | Complex peaks observed near 3000 1/cm, indicating potential hydrogen bonding. |

| FTIR-002  | Almond Oil             | 3400              | A solitary peak likely corresponding to C-H stretching. |



#### Table 2: Microplate Reader Measurement



| Sample ID | Mixture Components         | Optical Density (OD) | Remarks                   |

|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|

| MRX-001   | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 2.8                | High OD suggests a potential turbidity issue. |

| MRX-002   | Almond Oil, Beeswax        | 1.5                  | Moderate OD, indicating lower interaction levels. |

### Other Observations



- **PCR Testing**: The Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin mixture exhibited a Ct value of 25, indicating moderate amplification efficiency when tested with PCR-96.

- **Centrifugation Result**: The Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin mixture achieved peak separation at 12000 RPM, revealing distinct stratification.



- **NMR Analysis**: For the Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E sample, a peak was detected at 5 ppm. However, such deviation may not be pertinent to the primary focus of this study.



## Discussion



The analysis exhibited a wide range of chemical interactions and physical characteristics across various mixtures. For example, the almond oil-based samples showed significant vibrational interactions, as evident by FTIR results. In contrast, the coconut oil mixtures showed more notable separation properties, confirmed by centrifugation results. The rheometer results highlighted considerable viscosity in almond oil mixtures, pinpointing potentially useful applications in industries requiring high-thickness oils.



## Conclusion



The detailed analytical study successfully captured complex data from multiple instrument readings, revealing insightful correlations between mixture components and their physical and chemical properties. Scatterings of seemingly irrelevant data reflect the natural complexity in lab data, ensuring thorough examination beyond surface-level readings. Each method provided unique insights, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the mixtures studied.
