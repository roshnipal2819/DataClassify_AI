## Experimental Analysis



### Methodologies



1. **Four Ball Wear Test (Model: FB-1000)**  

   - **Sample:** Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E  

   - **Measurement:** Wear Scar Diameter  

   - **Observation:** The sample exhibited a wear scar diameter of 0.298 mm, indicating moderate lubrication efficiency under test conditions.



2. **Gas Chromatography (Model: GC-2010)**  

   - **Sample:** Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  

   - **Concentration:** Key Volatile Compound

   - **Result:** 14.5 ppm of the compound was detected, reflecting the presence of an expected aromatic profile for potential nutritional benefits.



3. **FTIR Spectroscopy (Model: FTIR-8400)**  

   - **Sample:** Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin  

   - **Peak Measurement:** Spectral Absorbance  

   - **Results:** The primary peak observed at 1550 cm^-1 suggests the presence of aliphatic chains common in these components.



4. **UV-Vis Spectrophotometry (Model: UV-2600)**  

   - **Sample:** Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin  

   - **Absorbance:** 2.1 Abs  

   - **Observation:** High absorbance value demonstrating substantial interaction between the components.



### Irrelevant Note

- The lab coat worn was blue.



5. **PCR Analysis (Model: PCR-96)**  

   - **Sample:** Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol  

   - **Cycle Threshold (Ct):** 35  

   - **Commentary:** This threshold suggests the presence of nucleic acids conducive to PCR amplification, albeit unrelated to this sample.



### Additional Data



6. **Conductivity Measurement (Model: CM-215)**  

   - **Sample:** Coconut Oil, Glycerin  

   - **Conductivity:** 650 µS/cm  

   - **Conclusion:** Elevated ionic content implying a potential for higher reactivity.



7. **Visible Light Spectrometry (Model: Alpha-300)**  

   - **Sample:** Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  

   - **Wavelength:** 450 nm  

   - **Note:** Indicative of energy absorption characteristic patterns for analysis.

### Complex Observations



- **Ion Chromatography (IC-2100)**

  - Coconut oil exhibited a trace ionic concentration at 0.045 mM, correlated with its purity level and intrinsic dielectric properties.



- **Potentiometric Titration (T-905)**

  - The acidity/basicity of almond oil was established with a molarity of 0.007 M, which is essential for assessing the oil's stability and shelf-life.



- **pH Analysis (PH-700)**

  - The sample containing Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E demonstrated a pH of 8.3, aligning with an alkaline nature favorable in cosmetics formulations.
