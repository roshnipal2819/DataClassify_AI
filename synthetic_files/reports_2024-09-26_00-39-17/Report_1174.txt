### Introduction



In this comprehensive study, we explored the physicochemical properties of various oil-based samples combined with different test agents, utilizing a spectrum of modern analytical instruments. This aims to elucidate the behavior of components under study, such as Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil, and Coconut Oil when interacting with substances like Cetyl Alcohol and Glycerin. The complexity of these mixtures requires attention to detail to derive meaningful inferences from our observations.

### Results and Discussion



The analyzed mixtures exhibited diverse physical and chemical behaviors depending on the constituent materials and conditions of the analysis. A juxtaposition in properties, such as neutral pH levels for Almond-based mixtures and high viscosities for Coconut Oil composites, reflects underlying molecular interactions. 



The consistency in viscosity observed in coconut oil mixtures is indicative of a stable emulsion system. Furthermore, discrepancies in spectroscopic and chromatographic measurements highlight the heterogeneity inherent within natural samples. The integration of varied methodologies enabled us to obtain a multidimensional perspective of each sample's properties.
