# Lab Report: Analysis of Various Oil-Based Mixtures



## Introduction



This report presents the findings from a series of tests conducted on various oil-based mixtures. Each test aimed to evaluate specific physical and chemical properties using different analytical instruments. Our objective was to understand the behavior of these mixtures under varying conditions and how each ingredient contributes to the overall characteristics of the sample. The mixture formulations and corresponding data are detailed with both relevant and extraneous information interwoven throughout the report.

## Results and Discussion



### Wear Protection Test

The Four Ball Tester FB-1000 was employed to assess the wear protection capability of **Sample A**.



- **Observation**: The wear scar diameter observed was 0.350 mm.

- **Interpretation**: This indicates moderate resistance to wear, particularly in lubricative properties exploited by coconut oil in conjunction with glycerin.



#### Table 1: Wear Test Results

| Sample   | Instrument          | Wear Scar (mm) |

|----------|---------------------|----------------|

| Sample A | Four Ball FB-1000   | 0.350          |



### Chemical Concentration

The HPLC System HPLC-9000 measured the concentration of components in **Sample B**.



- **Observation**: The concentration of components detected was 5.50 mg/L.

- **Interpretation**: This suggests a robust presence of coconut oil intrinsic compounds mixed with beeswax.



### Viscosity Measurements

Using the Rheometer R-4500, we analyzed **Sample C** for its resistance to flow.



- **Observation**: Viscosity was recorded at 150.4 Pa-s.

- **Interpretation**: High viscosity indicates substantial resistance, highlighting the thickening effect of cetyl alcohol on coconut oil and glycerin combination.



#### Table 2: Viscosity and Conductivity

| Sample   | Instrument        | Viscosity (Pa-s) | Conductivity (uS/cm) |

|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|

| Sample C | Rheometer R-4500  | 150.4            | N/A                  |

| Sample E | N/A               | N/A              | 1200                 |



### Molecular Analysis

The Mass Spectrometer MS-20 evaluated the molecular structure of **Sample D**.



- **Observation**: A mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 780 was observed.

- **Interpretation**: This value corresponds to the molecular mass fragment indicative of almond oil components in presence with cetyl alcohol and Vitamin E.



### Conductivity Analysis

Electrical conductivity for **Sample E** was measured using Conductivity Meter CM-215.



- **Observation**: Conductivity measured was 1200 uS/cm.

- **Interpretation**: High conductivity points to potential ionizable species present in jojoba oil mixture.



### Thermal and Optical Properties

- **Thermal Stability**: Thermocycler TC-5000 recorded a stable thermal state in **Sample A** at 37Â°C.

- **Optical Density**: Microplate Reader MRX measured **Sample B** with an OD of 0.55.



### Centrifugation

Centrifuge X100 was employed to analyze sedimentation in **Sample E**.



- **Observation**: Performance at 10500 RPM yielded significant phase separation, suggesting heterogeneous nature of the jojoba oil mixture.



#### Table 3: Sedimentation Results

| Sample   | Instrument    | RPM   |

|----------|---------------|-------|

| Sample E | Centrifuge X100| 10500 |

## Conclusion



The tests revealed diverse traits across the different oil-based mixtures, guided by their compositions and external analyses. Each sample displayed unique properties in line with expectations based on its constituent ingredients. These insights reveal essential data beneficial for future enhancements to product formulation strategies.

### Additional Observations



Random considerations during the experimental phase revealed unrelated anomalies, such as an unexpected ambient temperature fluctuation on the test day and a brief power interruption affecting instrument recalibration. While largely inconsequential, these factors were noted for thoroughness.
