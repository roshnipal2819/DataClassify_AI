# Lab Report: Analysis of Various Oil Blends



## Introduction



This lab report details the results of a comprehensive analysis conducted on several oil-based mixtures using various analytical instruments. The primary compositions tested include combinations of oils such as almond, coconut, and jojoba with additional ingredients like beeswax, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, and vitamin E. Each mixture was subjected to a series of tests to determine pH levels, thermal properties, mass, molecular structures, and viscosity. The tests were performed with a focus on understanding the interactions among these components.



### Materials and Methods



Multiple instruments were employed to analyze the samples:



- **pH Meter PH-700**

- **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000**

- **Mass Spectrometer MS-20**

- **Titrator T-905**

- **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**

- **Spectrometer Alpha-300**

- **Viscometer VS-300**



Each test group, such as 'Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E,' was studied using the mentioned instruments, with results documented in inconsistent formats to challenge data extraction techniques.



## Observations and Results



### pH Measurements



| Sample Composition          | Device             | pH    |

|-----------------------------|--------------------|-------|

| Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin| pH Meter PH-700    | 7.5   |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin| pH Meter PH-700 | 6.8   |



The above table showcases the pH levels of two mixtures. Notably, the almond oil mixture demonstrated a slightly more neutral pH compared to the coconut oil blend, suggesting varying acid-base interactions among components.



### X-Ray Diffraction and Mass Spectrometry



| Sample Composition              | Device                  | Measurement   | Unit |

|---------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|------|

| Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin  | X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000 | 120           | °C  |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  | Mass Spectrometer MS-20 | 850           | m/z  |



Anomalously, the coconut oil-based mixture's thermal property revealed a diffraction measurement of 120°C, which, while relevant, unrelated, presents an intriguing data point when juxtaposed with its mass spectrometric analysis yielding a mass-to-charge ratio of 850 m/z for the jojoba oil mixture.



### NMR and Spectrometric Analysis



- **NMR Results for Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E:**

  - **Device:** NMR Spectrometer NMR-500

  - **Chemical Shift:** 15 ppm



The NMR analysis provided insights into the structural arrangements and potential chemical shifts within the molecular spheres.



- **Spectral Observations (Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin):**

  - **Device:** Spectrometer Alpha-300

  - **Wavelength:** 400 nm



This wavelength indicated the absorbance properties of the mixture, crucial for understanding potential light interaction effects in lotions or cosmetics.



### Viscosity Measurements



| Sample Composition                     | Viscosity (cP) |

|----------------------------------------|----------------|

| Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin          | 7204.96        |

| Coconut Oil                            | 4929.89        |

| Almond Oil, Glycerin                   | 7636.74        |



The data reveals varying degrees of fluidity, with the almond oil and glycerin mixture showing the highest viscosity among tested samples, signifying denser molecular arrangement compared to standalone coconut oil.



#### Random Observation



Interestingly, during the process, external interference was noted from spectral overlapping, most likely attributed to an ambient light source in the laboratory, potentially influencing readings under the Spectrometer Alpha-300.



## Conclusion



This report provides an intricate look into the behavior of oil-based mixtures when subjected to various analytical techniques. These complex patterns observed in the data are essential for further applications in product formulation, particularly in cosmetic and nutritional fields. While some unrelated measurements provide insight into potential real-world testing conditions, the deeper understanding of interactions among these ingredients establishes foundational knowledge for future explorations.
