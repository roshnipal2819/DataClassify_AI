#### Table 1: Spectroscopy and Thermal Analysis



| Equipment           | Ingredients                     | Measurement   | Unit        |

|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|-------------|

| FTIR-8400           | Almond Oil, Beeswax             | 3650          | 1/cm        |

| NMR-500             | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | 5.2           | ppm         |

| XRD-6000            | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  | 87            | C           |

| Thermocycler TC-5000| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol       | 37            | C           |



**Observations:** The FTIR spectrum presented distinct absorption peaks characteristic of triglycerides in the almond oil mixture, while the NMR analysis revealed proton alignment close to expected values for saturated oils.

| Equipment       | Ingredients                      | Measurement | Unit    |

|-----------------|----------------------------------|-------------|---------|

| Four Ball FB-1000| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 0.850       | mm      |

| Viscometer VS-300| Coconut Oil, Gum                | 5370.38     | cP      |

| Viscometer VS-300| Coconut Oil, Beeswax            | 4682.94     | cP      |

| Titrator T-905  | Coconut Oil, Glycerin            | 0.045       | M       |



**Results Interpretation:** Viscosity readings were notably higher in the gum-based mixture, indicating potential thixotropic behavior suitable for stabilizing emulsions.



#### Table 3: pH and Conductivity Metrics



| Equipment         | Ingredients                     | Measurement | Unit    |

|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|---------|

| pH Meter PH-700   | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol       | 6.8         | pH      |

| Conductivity Meter CM-215 | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | 345       | ÂµS/cm   |



**Additional Notes:** The neutral pH of the jojoba oil mixture suggests gentle compatibility with skin, while enhanced conductivity in the almond blend indicates potential use in conductive formulations.



### Discussion



The combinations tested reveal diverse physicochemical interactions. For example, mixtures of coconut oil with gum exhibited high viscosity, advantageous for applications requiring thickening agents. Conductivity and pH assessments highlight valuable insights for tailoring formulations to desired specifications, such as solubility profiles or biocompatibility.



In contrast with initial postulations, temperature stability assessed via X-Ray diffraction showed that almond oil blends maintained structural integrity under thermal stress. Such discoveries deepen the understanding of formulation resilience across varied temperature ranges.



At times, instrumental limitations, such as spectral interference (though irrelevant in this context), were noted and addressed with calibration adjustments, ensuring data reliability. The random inclusion of irrelevant, misleading text correlates to potential prior errors, swiftly rectified. 



### Conclusion



This multifaceted analysis supports the strategic selection of bio-based ingredients for tailored applications in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors. The attributes documented herein guide thoughtful integration into innovative products that embrace sustainability and functionality.
