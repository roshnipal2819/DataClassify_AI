### Further Analysis and Observations



The conductivity data reveals the ion exchange potential between different mixtures. For instance, Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin exhibited a conductivity of 1500 uS/cm, indicating a significant ion-mediated interaction compared to Jojoba Oil and Gum with a conductivity of 1300 uS/cm. These variations might reveal underlying electrochemical dynamics or phase behavior indicative of emulsification properties.

Device: Conductivity Meter CM-215



| Sample ID | Ingredients                       | Conductivity (uS/cm) |   

|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|   

| Sample C1 | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 1500                 |  

| Sample C2 | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol          | 1200                 |  

| Sample C3 | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin      | 1600                 |  

| Sample C4 | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E         | 1300                 |  

| Sample C5 | Almond Oil, Glycerin               | 1400                 |  



NMR data provides insights into molecular environments within samples, where resonances such as those noted at 5.2 ppm for Coconut Oil mixtures indicate specific hydrogen arrangements possibly due to ester functionalities or alcohol hydroxyl groups.

| Sample D5 | Almond Oil, Glycerin               | 5.5            |  



Another complex aspect is thermal behavior as assessed by X-Ray diffraction, with results such as 90°C for Coconut Oil-based mixtures suggesting crystalline or semi-crystalline phases. Each sample's unique behavior under high energy conditions; like the anomalous 92°C noted error for Almond Oil and Glycerin, affirms the diversity across formulations.

## Experimental Challenges and Observations



Unexpected variations were encountered due to differences in room temperature and humidity, which affected the NMR readings slightly. Moreover, a surprising viscosity reading of 5386.09 cP for a Coconut Oil and Gum mixture was an outlier, prompting a re-evaluation of the mixture’s stability.



## Conclusion



The detailed physio-chemical analysis performed across different mixtures provided a thorough understanding of their intrinsic properties, shedding light on potential applications and storage guidelines. Each sample's unique profile revealed fascinating insights into the behavior of cosmetic formulations under varying conditions.  



Conclusively, the data contributes to optimizing formulations tailored for specific purposes, enhancing their functional and sensory characteristics.
