## Instrumental Analysis



### **1. Mass Spectrometry**



Utilizing the Mass Spectrometer MS-20, we examined an Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E mixture. The measurement results were observed at 1500 m/z, suggesting a complex interplay of hydrocarbons and additional functional groups.  



**Key Notes:**



- The mass-to-charge ratio signifies the presence of high molecular weight compounds.

- Detectable peaks indicate potential ester linkages and phenolic compounds.



### **2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)**



The NMR Spectrometer NMR-500 was employed to analyze an Almond Oil and Vitamin E mixture. The results, observed at 15 ppm, highlight chemical shifts indicative of aromatic proton environments.



**Interesting Irrelevant Information:**



Did you know that almond oil is often used in ancient traditional medicine for wound healing?



### **3. UV-Vis Spectrophotometry**



The mixture of Almond Oil and Cetyl Alcohol was subjected to analysis using the UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600. An absorbance reading of 2.7 Abs was recorded, indicative of unsaturated compounds and possible conjugated systems present in the sample.



| Instrument | Mixture | Measurement Type | Value |

|------------|---------|------------------|-------|

| MS-20 | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | m/z | 1500 |

| NMR-500 | Almond Oil, Vitamin E | ppm | 15 |

| UV-2600 | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol | Abs | 2.7 |



### **4. Titration Analysis**



Employing the Titrator T-905, the Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E mixture was titrated, resulting in a molarity of 0.008 M. This indicates a minimal presence of acidic or basic ions within the mixture.



### **5. pH Measurement**



The PH-700 meter was used to evaluate a Jojoba Oil and Cetyl Alcohol with Vitamin E mixture. The pH value recorded was 6.8, suggesting a near-neutral environment, ideal for applications involving skin-contact formulations.

## Additional Characterizations



### **X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)**



Using the X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000, Almond Oil and Glycerin mixture was characterized by diffraction peaks observed at 120°C. The crystalline phases identified support the presence of structured lipid domains.



### **Microplate Reading**



A Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin mixture was analyzed using the Microplate Reader MRX, revealing an optical density (OD) of 3.2. This is consistent with a solution exhibiting moderate turbidity.

## Chromatographic Analysis



### **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)**



An LC-400 Liquid Chromatograph analyzed the mixture of Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E with a concentration of 300 µg/mL. Additionally, the HPLC-9000 system evaluated a Coconut Oil and Beeswax mixture with Vitamin E, showing concentrations at 450 mg/L.



### **Viscosity Measurements**



The viscosity of Jojoba Oil combined with Cetyl Alcohol and Glycerin was assessed using the VS-300 Viscometer, with a viscosity of 2568.22 cP. Contrastingly, the Coconut Oil, Gum, and Vitamin E mixture recorded a markedly higher viscosity of 5153.96 cP.



| Instrument | Mixture | Measurement | Type | Value |

|------------|---------|-------------|------|-------|

| HPLC-9000 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | Concentration | mg/L | 450 |

| VS-300 | Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E | Viscosity | cP | 5153.96 |



### **Centrifugation**



The Centrifuge X100 was employed for Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E. Operational conditions were set at a speed of 13000 RPM, facilitating efficient separation of the liquefied and solidified phases present in the mixture.
