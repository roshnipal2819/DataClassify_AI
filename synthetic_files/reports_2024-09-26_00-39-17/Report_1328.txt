## Results and Discussion



The PCR analysis indicated robust amplification for the **Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E** mixture, suggesting high compatibility and interaction among constituents.



The **Coconut Oil, Beeswax** combination exhibited increased concentration as measured by the Liquid Chromatograph, likely due to the effectiveness of the chromatographic separation under selected parameters.



The UV-Vis Spectrophotometer findings revealed moderate absorbance in **Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol** mixtures, aligning with the intrinsic optical properties of these compounds. Similar results have been recorded in past literature, indicating repeatable and reliable outcomes.



The NMR Spectroscopy identified clear peaks for glycerin, affirming its presence in the **Coconut Oil** based mixtures. This structural insight could be pivotal in formulation adjustments.



Analyzing viscosity through the Rheometer and Viscometer across different samples highlighted vastly distinct rheological behaviors, a factor critical in end-user sensory experience.



The findings from varying instrumental analyses, when combined, provide a holistic understanding of the mixtures' properties, paving the way for optimized formulations in cosmetic applications.
