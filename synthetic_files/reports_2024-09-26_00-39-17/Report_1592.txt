## Results and Discussion



### Jojoba Oil Mixture



- **X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD-6000)** detected organic components within the range of [0-180] C. Observations showed unclear crystal structures due to presence of Vitamin E.

- **FTIR Spectrometer (FTIR-8400)** indicated strong C-H stretch between 2800-3000 1/cm, standard for jojoba oil.

- **Centrifuge (X100)** was set at 10,000 RPM for optimal separation of beeswax and oil phases.

- **HPLC System (HPLC-9000)** detected components <0.01 mg/L, indicating high purity and similarity among jojoba oil constituents.



### Almond Oil Mixture



- **Liquid Chromatograph (LC-400)** established presence of glycerin in a broad range [0.01-500] ug/mL.

- **Gas Chromatograph (GC-2010)** confirmed cetyl alcohol and glycerin presence between 0.1-1000 ppm, highlighting effective blending.

- **Rheometer (R-4500)** resulted in a shear viscosity of approximately 0.45 Pa-s, pointing to a stable colloidal solution.

- **Spectrometer (Alpha-300)** showed absorbance in the range [190-1100] nm, typical for natural oils with minimal solvent presence.



### Coconut Oil Mixture



- **Conductivity Meter (CM-215)** recorded conductivity values nearing 1500 uS/cm.

- **Microplate Reader (MRX)** observed absorbance rates between 0.1-4.0 OD, suggesting varying concentrations of saturated lipids.

- **Viscometer (VS-300)** determined viscosity at 5043.76 cP for coconut oil mixture, indicating a highly viscous property.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis showcases the diverse characteristics of oil mixtures. The advanced instrumentation provides detailed insights, enabling precise applications in various industries.



### Additional Observations

Despite the thorough methodology, a random temperature spike during the spectrometry tests suggested a potential calibration issue, irrelevant to the current experiment. Such anomalies must be addressed to ensure accuracy in future tests. 



Furthermore, while the Coconut Oil mixture displayed expected behaviors, unexpected absorbance peaks in unexplored spectrums warrant further exploration.
