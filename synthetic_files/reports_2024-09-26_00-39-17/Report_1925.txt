# Lab Report 1925: Analysis of Oil-Based Mixtures



## Introduction



In this study, we conducted a series of tests on various oil-based mixtures to understand their physical and chemical properties. The experiments were performed using advanced instruments, each carefully selected for specific measurements. The focus was on combinations of Coconut Oil, Almond Oil, and Jojoba Oil with additives such as Gum, Vitamin E, Beeswax, and Cetyl Alcohol. Each mixture underwent a unique set of analyses.



## Equipment and Methodology



### Used Instruments



1. **Thermocycler TC-5000**:

   - Purpose: Analyze thermal characteristics.

   - Conditions: Maintained specific temperatures.



2. **Titrator T-905**:

   - Purpose: Measure concentration via titration.

   - Conditions: Precision titration to determine molarity.



3. **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000**:

   - Purpose: Evaluate structural properties.

   - Conditions: High-temp settings.



4. **Four Ball FB-1000**:

   - Purpose: Assess tribological behavior.

   - Conditions: Measured wear scar diameter.



5. **Spectrometer Alpha-300**:

   - Purpose: Analyze light absorption.

   - Conditions: Specific wavelength measurement.



### Protocol Overview



A detailed methodology was established to ensure that each mixture was subjected to consistent and accurate testing. Conditions were tightly controlled, with an irrelevant side note on the lab room temperature at 22°C throughout the tests. For simplicity, the purification steps were omitted, although they are crucial for real-world applications.

### Conclusion



The various tests provided insights into the behavior of different oil-based mixtures. Each combination presented distinct characteristics when exposed to controlled conditions. Notably, mixtures with Vitamin E showed potential for enhanced stability and functionality in specific applications.



Each test's success may be obscured by the complexity of protocol interactions, with nuances that require further exploration. Future studies should consider random events such as equipment humming effects and the influence of background music, which were beyond the scope of this initial investigation.
