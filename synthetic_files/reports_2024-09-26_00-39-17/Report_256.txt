### Observations and Discussions



#### Almond Oil Mixtures



The almond oil samples presented uniform characteristics across two measurement platforms: pH and nuclear magnetic resonance. 



- **pH Analysis (Almond Oil A)**: Demonstrated a steady pH value of 6.8, indicative of its mild acidity which complements its use in cosmetic formulations.

  

- **NMR Analysis (Nuclear Almond)**: Detected chemical shifts at 12.5 ppm suggestive of unique structural conformations likely influenced by beeswax interactions.



Interesting notes: 

- An unexpected absence of vibration modes was noted, however, without impact on the conclusions.



#### Coconut Oil Mixtures



The coconut oil technologies exhibited diversity in both properties measured and approaches applied:



- **Gas Chromatographic Analysis (Coconut Oil B)**: Measured contaminants at 250.5 ppm, revealing critical information about volatile compound concentrations.



- **Centrifugal Study (Centrifugal Coconut)**: At 12000 RPM, significant separation was achieved hinting towards a heterogeneous mixture that may separate under dynamic conditions.



- **Viscosity Studies (Viscous Coconut & Alt)**: It was found with discrepancies between measurements, 5131.86 vs. 4865.3 cP, suggesting batch inconsistency or instrumentation deviation.



##### Random Observations 

- It is intriguing that certain routine checks were skipped in the centrifugal study, although non-critical for this report.



#### Jojoba Oil Complexes



The jojoba mixtures were largely predictable, meeting expectations in physical dynamics and optical absorbances:



- **Thermal Conditioning (Jojoba Complex C)**: Held at 37°C, the response indicates it is stable for long-term temperature-sensitive applications.

  

- **Optical Density (Optical Jojoba)**: Exhibited an OD value of 1.4, facilitating understanding of solute dispersion.



## Conclusion



Each sample and its corresponding measurements provide an intricate portrait of compound interactions and behaviors across diverse mediums. Careful evaluation underscores the importance of comprehensive analytical strategies in revealing detailed characteristic profiles of complex formulations.



### Recommendations

- Further viscosity trials are recommended to validate the repeatability of Coconut Oil measurements.

- Additional exploration of alternative methodologies may elucidate unforeseen analytical insights.



## Appendices



Instruments utilized in analysis landmark the profound intersections between contemporary science and rudimentary understandings, driving future innovations and explorations in material science.
