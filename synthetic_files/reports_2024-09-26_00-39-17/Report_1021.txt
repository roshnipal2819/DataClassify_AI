# Lab Report: Analysis of Natural Oil Mixtures - Report_1021



## Introduction



The objective of this study was to analyze various natural oil mixtures, examining their physical properties using multiple sophisticated instruments. These tests aim to elucidate the characteristics and interactions within these mixtures, providing insights into their potential industrial applications. The mixtures were prepared using combinations of various oils and additives, with measurements taken using distinct analytical tools: X-ray Diffractometer, Spectrometer, pH Meter, Centrifuge, Ion Chromatograph, Microplate Reader, UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, Liquid Chromatograph, Rheometer, and Viscometer.



## Methods



### Equipment and Materials

The tests employed a comprehensive assortment of laboratory instruments, including:



- **XRD-6000 X-Ray Diffractometer**

- **Alpha-300 Spectrometer**

- **PH-700 pH Meter**

- **X100 Centrifuge**

- **IC-2100 Ion Chromatograph**

- **MRX Microplate Reader**

- **UV-2600 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer**

- **LC-400 Liquid Chromatograph**

- **R-4500 Rheometer**

- **VS-300 Viscometer**



Each mixture consisted of two or three components made from the following: Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E, Gum, Beeswax, and Glycerin.



### Observations and Measurements



The various mixtures were prepared and then assessed for specific parameters relevant to their physical and chemical properties. Details of these observations are as follows:



#### Jojoba Oil Mixtures



1. **Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E**



   - **X-Ray Diffraction**: The XRD-6000 was used to investigate the structural arrangements. Results were recorded at 45°C, indicating potential crystalline interactions between the oil and additives.



2. **Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E**



   - **pH Measurement**: Using the PH-700, the mixture's pH was found stable at 7, suggesting neutrality and potential compatibility with skin.



3. **Jojoba Oil with Beeswax and Vitamin E (engaged in dual testing)**



   - **Rheology**: The mixture displayed a viscosity of 500 Pa-s using the R-4500 Rheometer, indicative of thickening due to the solid lipid component, Beeswax.



   | Instrument          | Result                  |

   |---------------------|-------------------------|

   | Rheometer R-4500    | 500 Pa-s                |

   | Viscometer VS-300   | 2982.2 cP               |



   Irrelevant note: The laboratory windows face east, which provides optimal morning light conditions.



#### Almond Oil Mixtures



1. **Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E**



   - **Centrifugation**: High-speed rotation using the X100 Centrifuge achieved at 12000 RPM enhanced separation for detailed analysis.



2. **Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin**



   - **Ion Chromatography**: Conducted at 25 mM on the IC-2100, glycerin was accurately quantified, showing strong polar interactions.



   Additional irrelevant data: The lab technician loves almond-flavored coffee.



#### Coconut Oil Mixtures



1. **Coconut Oil, Glycerin**



   - **Microplate Reading**: Observations at 2.5 OD using the MRX Reader, suggesting high optical density and specular compatibility.



2. **Coconut Oil, Beeswax**



   - **UV-Vis Spectrophotometry**: Absorbance measured at 1.8 Abs with UV-2600, showing notable UV absorption properties.



3. **Coconut Oil with Vitamin E**



   - **Liquid Chromatography**: Vitamin E concentration was quantified at 200 μg/mL using LC-400, offering insights into nutritional value.



## Discussion



The series of tests provided comprehensive data about the physical and chemical behavior of various oil mixtures. Analyzing factors such as crystallinity, phase stability, viscosity, pH, and absorbance offered deep insights into their applicability in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceuticals. While some observations, such as viscosity differences (e.g., Jojoba vs. Almond Oil mixtures), showcased the dynamics influenced by particular additives like Beeswax and Vitamin E, others emphasized interactions evident under various conditions (e.g., UV absorbance in Coconut Oil mixtures).



Irrelevant yet intriguing observation: Several instruments wore custom dust covers, embroidered with daisies.



To conclude, each mixture exhibited distinct characteristics, elucidating the impacts of various components in determining their physical behavior and potential application value. Integrating these results could guide the formulation of consumer products optimizing the natural benefits of oils and botanically-derived additives.
