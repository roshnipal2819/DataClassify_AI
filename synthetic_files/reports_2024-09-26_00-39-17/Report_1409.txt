## Detailed Analysis



#### Table 2: Additional Readings and Anomalies



| Sample ID | Temperature (Â°C) | Pressure (atm) | Miscellaneous Notes           |

|-----------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|

| Sample 001   | 25               | 1              | Oil separation was noted when subjected to centrifugal forces. |

| Sample 002   | 27               | 1.1            | Spectrometer peak shift detected in the near-infrared region. |

| Sample 003   | 22               | 0.9            | Slight viscosity change upon vitamin E addition.              |



### Complex Descriptions and Results



The FTIR analysis using FTIR-8400 captured specific vibrational frequencies at 3512 1/cm indicative of Jojoba Oil's structural interaction with Cetyl Alcohol in the presence of Vitamin E. This suggests hydrogen bonding potential or structural modifications due to unsaturated bonds inherent in the oils.



Interestingly, Centrifuge X100 trials yielded high RPM stability, maintaining the centrifugation integrity of Almond Oil, Gum, and Glycerin, crucial for homogenized mixtures.



Further intriguing outcomes arose during the Rheometer R-4500 application, where Jojoba Oil's mix with Gin and Vitamin E demonstrated significant shear-thinning behavior at 45.3 Pa-s, an uncommon rheological response potentially influenced by the polyphenolic content in the Gin.

## Random Data Scatterings and Irrelevant Information



**Weather Conditions on Test Days:** Predominantly sunny with an unexpected drizzle observed on the third testing day, though unrelated to the study.



**Lab Inventory Note:** A misplaced box of pipette tips led to a temporary suspension of the PCR analysis.



**Unrelated Finding:** During testing, lab personnel discovered outdated reagent stock earmarked for disposal.

## Conclusion



The diverse analytical techniques employed elucidated various characteristics of oil-based mixtures, revealing significant insights into component interactions and stability. These findings have applications in food chemistry, cosmetics formulation, and even potential pharmaceutical utilizations.



### Recommendations



Future experiments should explore varying temperatures and pressures to expand the understanding of these material behaviors under a broader range of conditions. Additionally, investigating cross-reactivity potential between different additives could yield novel formulation strategies.
