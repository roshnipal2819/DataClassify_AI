### Observations



Table 1: **Analysis Summary**



| Sample Composition              | Instrument Used                   | Key Measurement                        | Value           |

|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|

| Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E      | FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400       | Wave Number                            | 1680 1/cm       |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | Thermocycler TC-5000             | Temperature (Melting Point)            | 55°C            |

| Coconut Oil                     | HPLC System HPLC-9000             | Impurity Level                         | 0.50 mg/L       |

| Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin   | PCR Machine PCR-96                | Cycle Threshold                        | 28 Ct           |

| Almond Oil                      | Rheometer R-4500                  | Viscosity                              | 45 Pa-s         |



Irrelevant Note: While almond oil is often cited for its mild properties, it is critical to note that it was historically utilized in embalming rituals within ancient cultures, which has no bearing on its cosmetic applications today.

| Sample Composition               | Instrument Used                 | Measurement Type                       | Value            |

|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|

| Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E            | X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000   | Temperature (Transition)               | 100°C            |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E   | Microplate Reader MRX           | Optical Density                        | 2.5 OD           |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin    | Mass Spectrometer MS-20         | Mass/Charge Ratio                      | 150 m/z          |



Additional Observation: The historical significance of X-ray diffraction might lead one to overestimate the importance of crystallinity in oils, though the primary utility here lies in structural confirmation.



### Detailed Descriptions



**FTIR Analysis:**

Utilizing the FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400, the spectral data indicated a notable 1680 1/cm peak, symptomatic of stretching within carbonyl compounds present in the Almond Oil, Gum, and Vitamin E mixture. The gum fraction appears to enhance the fingerprint region, although this requires further solvent analysis for confirmation.



**Thermal Analysis:**

Thermocycler data of Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E displayed a sharp phase change at 55°C. This denotes a potential solidification range indicating compatibility between the alcohol and oil, which might be beneficial for product formulations under tropical storage conditions.



Irrelevant Information: Interestingly, in Elizabethan times, cetyl alcohol-like substances were used in candle making, providing a potential historical context unrelated to modern-day applications.



**HPLC Insights:**

A solitary Coconut Oil sample evaluated using the HPLC System HPLC-9000 displayed minimal impurity presence at 0.50 mg/L. This purity suggests potential utility in food-safe applications pending lipid profile clarification.



**PCR Evaluation:**

Almond Oil mixtures demonstrated notable biochemical activity, achieving a Ct value of 28. A lower threshold might indicate a higher presence of glycerolipids, which warrants additional molecular investigation.



**Viscosity Measurements:**

The rheometer recorded a significant viscosity level of 45 Pa-s for Almond Oil mixtures. Although high, this is congruent with the rheological behavior expected of complex organic polymers.



Concluding Note: Viscosity measures are a fraction of the entire viscosity analysis but aid immensely in the touch and feel quality assessment for consumer acceptance studies.



### Conclusion



This report underscores the critical importance of deploying a multi-faceted analytical approach to fully characterize the dynamics within natural oil mixtures. The data gleaned pave the way for formulating products with targeted attributes potentially advantageous across medicinal, cosmetic, and nutritional sectors.



Final Comment: Further studies are necessary to explore the correlation between observed properties and shelf-life stability, a growing concern in natural formulation science.
