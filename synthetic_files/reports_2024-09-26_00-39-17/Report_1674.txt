## Discussion



The centrifuge tests revealed significant differences in separation efficiency, highlighting the importance of RPM in processing mixtures. In particular, the mixture containing Almond Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin displayed improved separation at higher speeds. This was consistent with expectations based on viscosity differences.



Spectrometric analysis determined that mixtures containing Vitamin E exhibited higher absorption at shorter wavelengths, which could indicate a complex interaction between Vitamin E and other compounds in the mixture.



Unexpectedly, the thermocycler test at a constant temperature of 37°C showed minimal thermal reaction, suggesting the stability of the Almond Oil and Beeswax mixture under these conditions. The FTIR Spectrometer identified key functional groups within the mixture, providing insight into chemical composition and potential reactivity.



Furthermore, results from the Liquid Chromatograph indicated the presence of significant levels of dissolved compounds, particularly in mixtures involving Gum.



## Conclusion



Overall, this comprehensive analysis highlights the varied physical and chemical behaviors of mixed substances when subjected to different experimental conditions. The results have practical implications in the formulation and stability testing of cosmetic and food products.



Understanding these characteristics is vital for the development of products tailored to specific applications and ensuring quality control. Further research is needed to explore how these mixtures behave under extended thermal cycling and different solvent environments.
