## Introduction

This report documents the analysis of various oil-based mixtures using several analytical techniques, including UV-Vis Spectrophotometry, Microplate Reading, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Mass Spectrometry, and Viscosity measurements. Each analysis utilizes a unique combination of components, which are observed and interpreted accordingly. This comprehensive study seeks to explore the optical, chemical, and physical properties of these mixtures to understand their potential applications and characteristics.



## Materials and Methods

The following equipment was utilized for analysis:



- **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600**: Used to determine the absorbance of light in mixtures.

- **Microplate Reader MRX**: Measured optical density (OD) to evaluate concentration variations.

- **HPLC System HPLC-9000**: Analyzed compound presence in mg/L.

- **PCR Machine PCR-96**: Quantified Ct (Cycle Threshold) for DNA detection.

- **Mass Spectrometer MS-20**: Identified molecular mass (m/z).

- **Viscometer VS-300**: Determined viscosity in centipoise (cP).



### Observations

During the experimentation period, several key observations were noted:



- The interaction of Coconut Oil with Cetyl Alcohol and Vitamin E displayed complex behavior under UV light.

- The highly viscous nature of Coconut Oil in combination with Beeswax showed peculiar consistency, enhancing potential product stability.



### Experimental Conditions

Detailed analysis of each sample was performed under controlled temperature and pressure to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Random Information Interlude

Here, we introduce a seemingly unrelated tidbit: the viscosity of honey is generally around 2000-10000 cP, greatly depending on temperature and composition. Such information provides a reference point for our viscosity measurements.



## Discussion

The analyses revealed distinct characteristics in each oil-based mixture:



- **UV-Vis Spectroscopy & Microplate Reading**: Both exhibited sensitivity to the presence of Vitamin E, affecting absorbance and OD readings.

- **HPLC & Mass Spectrometry**: Highlighted a noteworthy concentration of active components, notably in mixtures containing Coconut Oil and Cetyl Alcohol.

- **PCR**: Low Ct values in certain samples indicate high initial concentrations of nucleic acids, marking them as potential candidates for biological research.

- **Viscosity**: The results indicate a high viscosity range in Coconut Oil-based mixtures, attributing to their stability as potential emulsifiers in cosmetic products.



## Conclusion

The integration of various analytical techniques uncovered intricate details about each mixture's composition and potential applications. Future studies might focus on optimizing these mixtures for commercial use in health and beauty products.
