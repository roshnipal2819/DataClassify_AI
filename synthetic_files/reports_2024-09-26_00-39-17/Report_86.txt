The following instruments were utilized in the analysis to gather data on different properties:



- **Conductivity Meter CM-215**

- **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000**

- **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100**

- **Mass Spectrometer MS-20**

- **Four Ball FB-1000**

- **Thermocycler TC-5000**

- **HPLC System HPLC-9000**

- **Centrifuge X100**

- **Rheometer R-4500**

- **Viscometer VS-300**



Each test was conducted on mixtures composed of oils (e.g., Coconut, Jojoba), with substances like Beeswax, Gum, and Vitamin E, generating intricate insight into their chemical and physical behavior.

## Discussion



The analysis indicates substantial variations in physical properties due to different compositions. The reaction between Jojoba Oil and Beeswax generates a formulation favorable to low-temperature applications, as evidenced by the lower scar diameter in Four Ball testing. 



Conversely, the thermocycler readings for Coconut Oil with additions reflect higher stability under applied thermal stress, reinforcing its potential in temperature-variable environments.



Additionally, complex viscosity profiles from multiple viscometer tests highlighted the non-linear behavior of the mixed compounds, underscoring the critical role of Gum in modulating fluid dynamics, as observed by the contrasting viscosity measurements.

## Conclusion



The intricate series of experiments demonstrates the complementary effects of component interactions within mixtures, shaping their utility in targeted applications. Variances in measurements were primarily attributable to initial compound characteristics and instrument sensitivity. Further detailed investigation could elucidate the underlying mechanisms of observed phenomena, refining utilization strategies in practical applications.
