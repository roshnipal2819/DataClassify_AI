# Lab Report: Analysis of Various Mixtures



**Report ID:** 1453



**Objective:**  

The objective of this lab report is to analyze the properties and characteristics of different ingredient mixtures using several quantitative analysis techniques.



## Introduction  

In this study, we examine mixtures involving Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E, and Jojoba Oil, among others. The testing involves the utilization of advanced devices such as PCR Machines, Spectrometers, Thermocyclers, Microplate Readers, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and Viscometers. Each mixture is subjected to specific instruments to gather data on properties like viscosity, absorbance, and other chemical properties. This analytical exploration aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of each mixture's dynamic behaviors under controlled conditions.

## Observations and Results  



Randomly, amidst our observations, we noted that a bird was chirping outside the window, which had no impact on our data. Moreover, the lab temperature was maintained at optimal room conditions, ensuring consistency across experimental runs.



### Table 1: PCR and Thermal Analysis  



| Mixture                     | Equipment Used      | Measurement        | Unit |

|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|------|

| Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | PCR-96               | 28                 | Ct   |

| Coconut Oil, Vitamin E      | TC-5000             | 72                 | °C   |



### Complex Description: Spectroscopic and Optical Density Analysis  



The **Spectrometer Alpha-300** facilitated the absorption analysis at **660 nm** for the Jojoba Oil mixture, demonstrating characteristic peak behaviors indicating stable intermolecular interactions. The **Microplate Reader MRX** recorded an optical density (OD) of **2.3** for the Jojoba Oil and Beeswax mixture—a fascinating discovery integrating with Beeswax's unique binding properties.



### Table 2: HPLC and Viscosity Data  



| Mixture                     | Equipment Used | Measurement | Unit  |

|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------|-------|

| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E  | HPLC-9000      | 235.6       | mg/L  |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | VS-300         | 3086.14     | cP    |

| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin   | VS-300         | 1793.28     | cP    |

## Discussion  



The results highlight distinct physical and chemical characteristics intrinsic to each mixture. For instance, the PCR Cycle Threshold (Ct) for the **Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E** mixture reflects a dynamic molecular interaction stimulated within the PCR Machine. This contrasts the **Thermal Cycle** for Coconut Oil with Vitamin E demonstrating stability until **72°C**, as indicated by the Thermocycler TC-5000.



Furthermore, Jojoba Oil mixtures analyzed with the HPLC System HPLC-9000 and Viscometer VS-300 unveiled varying viscosities and concentration measures. Notably, mixtures containing Jojoba Oil and Beeswax yielded higher viscosity, whereas the inclusion of Gum influenced a moderate viscosity increment.

## Conclusion  



This comprehensive study reveals the unique interactive profiles of each analyzed mixture. The integration of advanced laboratory technology has facilitated an in-depth understanding, contributing valuable insight into formulation studies in industries such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food sciences, although they were not specifically the focus of this report.



In terms of non-relevancy, random equipment calibrations occasionally interspersed through analysis appear unrelated but underscored the necessity for continuous methodological audits as we continue with experimental rigor.
