## Introduction



The purpose of this report is to present the findings from a series of experiments conducted on different oil mixtures using various sophisticated instruments. This report covers tests performed on Almond Oil and Coconut Oil, both combined with additional additives. These mixtures were analyzed to observe their physicochemical properties and chemical compositions.



### Objective



To evaluate the properties such as viscosity, absorption, concentration, and stability of different oil mixtures using advanced analytical instruments.

2. **Gas Chromatograph GC-2010:**  

   - Sample: Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E  

   - Measurement: Parts per million (ppm)  

   - Observation: Sharp peaks, slight delay in retention



3. **Thermocycler TC-5000:**  

   - Sample: Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  

   - Measurement: Temperature (°C)  

   - Observation: Homogenous mixture upon heating



4. **Rheometer R-4500:**  

   - Sample: Almond Oil  

   - Measurement: Viscosity (Pa-s)  

   - Observation: Consistent flow behavior



5. **pH Meter PH-700:**  

   - Sample: Coconut Oil, Vitamin E  

   - Measurement: pH  

   - Observation: Stable pH level, slight acidity



6. **Four Ball FB-1000:**  

   - Sample: Almond Oil, Vitamin E  

   - Measurement: Wear scar diameter (mm)  

   - Observation: Minimal surface wear



7. **Microplate Reader MRX:**  

   - Sample: Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E  

   - Measurement: Optical Density (OD)  

   - Observation: Moderate turbidity



8. **Titrator T-905:**  

   - Sample: Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  

   - Measurement: Molarity (M)  

   - Observation: Reagent color change observed



9. **Viscometer VS-300:**  

   - Samples: 

     - Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol: Viscosity in centipoise (cP)

     - Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E: Viscosity (cP)  

   - Observation: Increase in viscosity with Vitamin E addition

### Observations:



- The introduction of Vitamin E into samples generally increased viscosity, as observed with the Viscometer VS-300.

- The wear test conducted using the Four Ball FB-1000 revealed minimal degradation when Vitamin E was present, suggesting its protective qualities.

- Consistent absorbance in UV-Vis spectroscopy indicates stability in the composition of Almond Oil mixtures.

## Discussion



The combination of different analytical instruments allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the properties and behaviors of the analyzed mixtures. Observations confirm that the addition of Vitamin E enhances certain characteristics of the oils, including viscosity and wear resistance.



### Conclusion



The analytical data suggests that both Almond and Coconut oils are effective carriers for delivering stable mixtures with additional vitamins and alcohols. The positive impact of Vitamin E on increasing the viscosity and reducing wear indicates potential for various cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.

The unexpected observations, such as the bird or the clock, serve as proof of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of laboratory environments. Each finding contributes uniquely to our growing understanding of these complex substances.
