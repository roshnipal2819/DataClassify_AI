### Complex Descriptions



Using the advanced spectrometric and chromatographic techniques, the mixtures were analyzed for their structural and chemical properties. For example, the Spectrometer Alpha-300 revealed a prominent absorption peak at 450 nm for the Coconut Oil Mixture 2, indicating the presence of complex molecular interactions between cetyl alcohol and glycerin. The corresponding data was verified through comparison with established reference standards, confirming the accuracy of the peak.



The Mass Spectrometer MS-20 provided a molecular ion peak at 850 m/z for Coconut Oil Mixture 3, displaying significant stability and suggestive of potential intermolecular bonding facilitated by beeswax and glycerin's structural compatibility. Additional molecular dynamics simulations might uncover further chemical behavior.



Each viscometric analysis underscored the uniqueness of the oils' rheological properties. The extraordinarily high viscosity of 4822.32 cP for Coconut Oil Mixture 4 with beeswax and vitamin E may suggest potential applications in formulations requiring thick consistency and stability.



## Conclusion



This series of experiments demonstrated the diversified compatibility and interaction of natural oils and cosmetic additives. Each analytical technique contributed critical data, enhancing the understanding of these mixtures' behavior under controlled experimental conditions. Further research could focus on evaluating these mixtures' long-term stability and potential applications in cosmetic formulations.
