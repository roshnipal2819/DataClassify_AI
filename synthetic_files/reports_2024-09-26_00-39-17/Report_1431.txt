# Lab Report 1431: Analysis of Various Oil Mixtures



## Introduction



In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of several oil mixtures using a variety of advanced instruments. Each mixture contained distinct ingredients, such as Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, and Coconut Oil, combined with other substances like Gum, Beeswax, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E. The objective was to analyze these mixtures to determine their physical and chemical properties, leveraging data collected from different analytical methods.



## Materials and Methods



The following instruments were used for the analysis:



- **HPLC System HPLC-9000** for high-performance liquid chromatography.

- **PCR Machine PCR-96** for polymerase chain reactions, although mainly for quantification purposes here.

- **Four Ball FB-1000** for wear measurement tests.

- **Rheometer R-4500** to measure viscosity.

- **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400** for detailed component separation.

- **Microplate Reader MRX** to assess optical density.

- **pH Meter PH-700** for pH measurements.

- **Conductivity Meter CM-215** to determine electrical conductivity.

- **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500** for nuclear magnetic resonance analysis.



Detailed parameter settings for each device are included in the appendices (See Appendix A - Device Specifications).



## Results and Discussion



### Table 1: Jojoba Oil Mixtures



| Ingredients                  | Instrument          | Measurement | Unit  |

|------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------|

| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin    | HPLC-9000           | 965.25      | mg/L  |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin| PCR-96              | 23.5        | Ct    |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E| LC-400              | 324.55      | ug/mL |

| Jojoba Oil, Gum              | PH-700              | 5.8         | pH    |



The analyses revealed significant insights. For instance, the emulsification ability of Jojoba Oil with Gum and Glycerin showed a high concentration of 965.25 mg/L, indicating a stable emulsion with potential rheological applications.



### Table 2: Almond Oil Mixture



| Ingredients               | Instrument          | Measurement | Unit  |

|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------|

| Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E| HPLC-9000           | 650.45      | mg/L  |



An intriguing observation was the superior antioxidant capacity of the Almond Oil and Vitamin E mixture, with a measured concentration suggesting its potential in therapeutic applications.



### Table 3: Coconut Oil Mixtures



| Ingredients                     | Instrument         | Measurement | Unit | Note                              |

|---------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|------|-----------------------------------|

| Coconut Oil, Gum                | FB-1000            | 0.750       | mm   | Wear reduction properties noted   |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol      | R-4500             | 250.3       | Pa-s | Consistency measurement           |

| Coconut Oil                     | MRX                | 2.1         | OD   | Optical properties assessed       |

| Coconut Oil, Glycerin           | CM-215             | 1500        | uS/cm| Conductivity indicates good solubility |

| Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin  | NMR-500            | 15.4        | ppm  | Structural complexity observed    |



Among the findings, the wear test conducted on the Coconut Oil and Gum mixture indicated excellent wear-resistant properties with only a 0.750 mm wear track diameter. 



## Observations



- **Viscosity Analysis**: The sample with Coconut Oil and Cetyl Alcohol exhibited a significant viscosity of 250.3 Pa-s, marking it as suitable for high-viscosity applications.

- **Conductivity Trends**: The electrical conductivity of Coconut Oil with Glycerin was remarkably high at 1500 uS/cm, which may be attributed to the ionic content facilitated by Glycerin.



## Conclusions



This lab report delineates the diverse properties of oil mixtures analyzed via comprehensive instrumentation. The results affirm that these mixtures, especially those involving Vitamin E and Glycerin, have promising applications across cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and lubrication fields. The implications of this study emphasize the essential roles these oils and mixtures can play in industry formulations.



### Irrelevant Data



Random tests on external samples such as "Solar Panel Dust Analysis" and "Aquatic Microbial Growth" were carried out but fall outside the scope of this report. Future studies may explore these domains to establish broader applicability contexts.
