# Lab Report 706: Analysis of Personal Care Product Ingredients



## Introduction



This report summarizes the findings of various analyses conducted on proprietary mixtures of personal care ingredients. The tests involved the application of diverse instrumentation techniques to assess chemical and physical properties. Each mixture includes specific ingredient combinations, and the report details observations, measurements, and results for these mixtures. The analysis was performed using HPLC, Ion Chromatography, PCR, Mass Spectrometry, Rheometry, and Viscosity Measurement.



## Test Procedures and Observations



### **1. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)**



#### Equipment: HPLC-9000

##### Observations:

The chromatographic run at the HPLC-9000 was performed efficiently with minimal baseline noise, indicating stable separation conditions for analytical evaluation.



1. **Sample: Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E**

   - Result: 450.32 mg/L

   - Observations: Distinct peaks at retention times corresponding to each component with an integration error below 1%.



2. **Sample: Coconut Oil, Glycerin**

   - Result: 250.11 mg/L

   - Observations: The absence of Vitamin E in this sample was confirmed through lack of corresponding peak.



### **2. Ion Chromatography**



#### Equipment: IC-2100

##### Observations:

The ion chromatographic analysis focused on determining the ionic content with sensitivity to trace levels.



**Samples Tested:**



- **Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin**

  - Concentration: 10.45 mM

  - Observations: Electroconductivity was consistent with expected theoretical values, confirming sample purity.



- **Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E**

  - Concentration: 5.49 mM

  - Observations: Satisfactory chromatogram after optimization of mobile phase pH.



### **3. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**



#### Equipment: PCR-96

##### Observations:

Amplification cycles were carefully monitored to avoid unspecific binding, and results showed clear differentiation between the tested samples.



- **Sample: Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin**

  - Cycle Threshold (Ct): 23.7

  - Observations: Sharp amplification, indicative of the presence of glycerol genes.



- **Sample: Jojoba Oil**

  - Cycle Threshold (Ct): 32.5

  - Observations: Late amplification cycle suggests less abundant target genes.



### **4. Mass Spectrometry**



#### Equipment: MS-20

##### Observations:

Multiple charged ion peaks in the mass spectra required extensive deconvolution for accurate mass determination.



- **Sample: Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E**

  - m/z: 1500.55

  - Observations: Peak fragmentation patterns confirmed emulsion stability.



- **Sample: Jojoba Oil, Gum**

  - m/z: 1200.85

  - Observations: The absence of Vitamin E confirmed through specific ion missing.



### **5. Rheometry**



#### Equipment: R-4500

##### Observations:

The shear-dependent viscosity ranged consistently across the test samples, allowing for viscosity moduli characterization.



- **Sample: Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin**

  - Viscosity: 75.2 Pa-s

  - Observations: Uniform shear thinning behavior across temperature variations.



- **Sample: Jojoba Oil, Beeswax**

  - Viscosity: 250.7 Pa-s

  - Observations: Elevated viscosity suggests potential crosslinking in constituents.



### **6. Viscosity Measurement**



#### Equipment: Viscometer VS-300

##### Observations:

Viscosity readings were influenced by shear rate, further validated by calibrating rotational speeds.



- **Sample: Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin**

  - Viscosity: 5245.46 cP

  - Observations: Indicates addition of thickening agents.



- **Sample: Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E**

  - Viscosity: 2597.18 cP

  - Observations: Smooth flow curve with minimal fluctuation.
