## Introduction



In this analytical study, various natural oil mixtures were evaluated using advanced spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. The natural oils, including Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, and Jojoba Oil, were mixed with specific compounds such as Cetyl Alcohol, Beeswax, Glycerin, Vitamin E, and Gum. Each mixture was treated as a distinct test sample and analyzed to investigate their chemical and physical properties.

### Complex Descriptions and Analysis



The study unveiled several noteworthy findings. For instance, FTIR spectroscopy of Coconut Oil and Cetyl Alcohol mixtures revealed a notable peak at 900 1/cm, suggesting characteristic ester bond vibrations indicating potential interactions between glycerol derivatives. This could imply new utility in emollient formulations.



UV-Vis spectral analysis of Almond Oil and Cetyl Alcohol at an absorbance of 2.1 Abs points towards chromophoric interactions, potentially from the rearrangement of unsaturated bonds under specific experimental conditions. Such properties might benefit light-mediated activation processes within cosmetic industries.



Finally, the high viscosity of Jojoba Oil and Gum (1885.42 cP) has corroborated its potential application in thickening agents, offering sustainable alternatives for eco-friendly product formulations.



The data reflects that each oil mixture's prevalent attributes could further research endeavors across multiple domains, including pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
