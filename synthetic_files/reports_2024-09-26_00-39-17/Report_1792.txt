### Results and Discussion



#### Physical Observations



The samples appeared homogenous and stable upon initial mixing. The viscosity varied significantly among samples, influencing their potential application as thickening agents or emulsifiers in cosmetic formulations.



#### Viscosity Measurements



Viscosity was a critical parameter analyzed by the Viscometer VS-300. Among the samples, Almond Oil mixed with Glycerin exhibited the highest viscosity at 7737.43 cP, suggesting a potential use in products requiring a thicker consistency.

#### Chemical Analysis



High Concentrations of Coconut Oil, Gum, and Glycerin were quantified using the HPLC System HPLC-9000, confirming a concentration of 50 mg/L. This suggests an efficient emulsification process suitable for complex cosmetic formulations.



pH analysis using pH Meter PH-700 revealed that a mixture of Jojoba Oil, Gum, and Vitamin E maintained a neutral pH of 7, aligning with skin-neutral formulations ideal for sensitive skin products.



#### Optical and Thermal Properties



The UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600 and Spectrometer Alpha-300 provided critical insights into the light absorption and wavelength characteristics of the samples. The Absorbance at 2.8 for Jojoba Oil combined with Cetyl Alcohol and Glycerin suggests good potential for UV protection utilities.



Additionally, thermal specifications via the Thermocycler TC-5000 highlighted the heat resilience of the Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin mixtures at 60°C, indicating stability under common cosmetic application temperatures.



### Conclusion



The comprehensive analysis of various cosmetic formulations revealed diverse physical and chemical characteristics that underscore their potential applications. High-viscosity samples are promising for products requiring substantial texture, while others demonstrate excellent emulsification, thermal stability, and a balanced pH conducive to skincare applications.



Further investigation might involve the impact of prolonged storage conditions and the exploration of active ingredient incorporation to enhance these formulations' functional properties.
