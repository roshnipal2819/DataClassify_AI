## Discussion



### Thermal Analysis

Both the Thermocycler TC-5000 and X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000 data indicate that Almond Oil-based mixtures exhibited notable thermal stability at elevated temperatures (56째C and 120째C). The presence of Beeswax and Gum appeared to enhance thermal resistance.



### Spectral Properties

Spectral results from the UV-Vis Spectrophotometer and the Spectrometer elucidate distinct absorbance capabilities in Coconut Oil mixtures. The UV-Vis data demonstrated a significant absorbance at 1.2 Abs for the Coconut Oil and Gum composition, suggesting strong interactions affecting light absorption.



### Chromatographic Analysis

The Liquid Chromatograph and Ion Chromatograph results illustrated the concentration dynamics of Jojoba Oil mixtures, with noteworthy dispersion in solvent properties. The HPLC results revealed that Jojoba Oil with Cetyl Alcohol achieved a consistent concentration of 5.6 mg/L.



### Viscosity Insights

Viscometer readings revealed that Almond Oil, when mixed with Glycerin, showed the highest viscosity at 7605.28 cP, emphasizing its potential use in applications requiring high-thickening agents. In contrast, the Jojoba Oil mixture displayed the lowest viscosity, making it suitable for light, spreadable formulations.



## Conclusion



Through this comprehensive study, distinct properties of various oil-based mixtures have been successfully characterized. The data demonstrates that each oil mixture holds potential for specific applications based on thermal stability, concentration properties, optical behaviors, and viscosity. Future explorations could delve into more detailed applications in cosmetic or pharmaceutical domains, considering these prominent features identified through our meticulous analysis.
