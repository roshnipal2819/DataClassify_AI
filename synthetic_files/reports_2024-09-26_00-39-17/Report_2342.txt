### Observations and Measurements



#### Table 1: Rheological and Spectroscopic Analysis

| Instrument                  | Mixture                  | Measurements         |

|-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------:|

| **Rheometer R-4500**        | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol | 12.3 Pa-s           |

| **Viscometer VS-300**       | Almond Oil, Gum           | 7502.77 cP          |

| **Viscometer VS-300**       | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | 7245.42 cP     |

| **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol | 15.2 ppm            |



Within the observations, a peculiar viscosity behavior was noted in almond-based mixtures, showing higher viscosity than expected, which may correlate with molecular interactions between gum and vitamin E molecules.



#### Table 2: Absorbance and Ion Content Analysis

| Instrument                       | Mixture                       | Measurements   |

|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------:|

| **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600** | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E     | 1.8 Abs       |

| **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100**   | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | 0.025 mM      |

| **Microplate Reader MRX**       | Jojoba Oil, Gum               | 2.1 OD        |



The absorbance at 1.8 in the UV-Vis spectrophotometer indicates potential for significant light-absorbing properties, possibly due to vitamin E's inherent chromophores enhancing the mixture's overall UV protection capability.



### Extra Observations (e.g., unexpected overtones in FTIR)



During the FTIR analysis with FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400 of almond oil and beeswax, distinct vibrational overtones near 3000 1/cm were detected, likely attributed to CH stretching vibrations. Also, the temperature stability was tested with the thermocycler (TC-5000), confirming stability up to 37°C. Additionally, the PCR Machine PCR-96 indicated a Ct value of 28, suggesting relatively low amplification potential for any genetic material within the tested formulations.



### Discussion



The mixtures exhibited unique properties with implications for industrial applications, where rheological and absorptive characteristics play crucial roles. Mixtures containing gum demonstrated high viscosity, enhancing stability yet potentially complicating application in spreadable products. A peculiar note is that low ionic content in the glycerin mixture could infer limited conductivity—vital for certain electrical applications.



Moreover, these findings present pivotal insights for product formulation, indicating that while certain properties (e.g., viscosity) are essential for product efficacy, they may also influence the tactile feel and consumer acceptance, requiring careful optimization.



### Conclusion



The investigations underscore the significance of an intricate understanding of component interaction within formulations. Each analytical technique contributed valuable data, fostering comprehensive interpretative analyses crucial for advancing formulation sciences. While certain datasets appeared trivial (e.g., ionic concentrations), their integration into formulation strategy remains indispensable for developing market-leading products.
