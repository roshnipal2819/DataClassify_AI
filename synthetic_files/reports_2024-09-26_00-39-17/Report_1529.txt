## Results and Observations



### Table 1: pH Measurements



| Sample                           | pH               |

|----------------------------------|------------------|

| Coconut Oil, Glycerin            | 7.5              |

| Almond Oil, Glycerin             | 6.8              |



*Observation:* The pH of mixtures containing Glycerin shows a slightly neutral to acidic range.

### Table 2: Spectrometer Analysis



| Sample                           | Wavelength (nm)  |

|----------------------------------|------------------|

| Jojoba Oil, Glycerin             | 450              |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E   | 300              |



*Complex Description:* The absorption spectroscopy reveals variations in the light absorption profiles, indicative of the unique chromophoric properties of the samples. Notably, Jojoba Oil in both mixtures shows distinctive absorption that can be tuned by altering its companion compounds.

### Table 3: Centrifugation Speed



| Sample                           | Speed (RPM)      |

|----------------------------------|------------------|

| Almond Oil, Gum                  | 8000             |

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 10000          |



*Observation:* The centrifugal stability, noted by the RPM setting, suggests that the sample "Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E" requires higher rotational speeds for phase separation, hinting at stronger intermolecular forces at play.

### Table 4: Chemical Analysis



| Sample                           | Concentration (ppm/mM) |

|----------------------------------|------------------------|

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol        | 0.05 mM (Ion Chromatograph) |

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 500 ppm (Gas Chromatograph) |



*Complex Description:* The differing concentration levels, measured via two sophisticated chromatographic techniques, demonstrate the diverse interactions between Almond Oil's fatty esters and Cetyl Alcohol's long-chain alcohol.

### Table 5: Viscosity Measurement



| Sample                           | Viscosity (cP)    |

|----------------------------------|-------------------|

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E   | 3135.35           |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol       | 5186.01           |

| Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E            | 2620.19           |



*Observation:* Viscosity results accentuate the rheological intricacies, particularly how Beeswax and Cetyl Alcohol significantly influence the resulting mixture's resistance to flow.

## Random Observations



During testing, random observations indicate some samples exhibited distinct odors and slight color changes when subjected to prolonged exposure to environmental conditions, suggesting potential oxidation reactions.



*Irrelevant Information:* Switching between different measuring devices required recalibrations – a procedure executed without incident. The lab temperature appeared consistently at 21°C, independent of outside weather changes.



## Conclusion



The diverse analytical results exemplify the varying properties of different mixtures of oils and other compounds. Through rigorous testing, it is evident that the interaction between each component significantly alters the physical and chemical characteristics of the mixture. Future research could delve deeper into understanding these interactions at the molecular level.



*Irrelevant Information:* Despite the advanced nature of instrumentation used, no mechanical failures were reported. Lab personnel maintained high accuracy levels throughout experimentation, making use of the institution's proprietary data management system.
