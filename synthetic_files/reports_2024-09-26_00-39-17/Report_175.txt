# Laboratory Report: Analysis of Cosmetic Ingredients



## Report ID: 175



### Introduction



In this report, we present the detailed analysis of various cosmetic ingredient mixtures using multiple advanced analytical techniques. The test samples include combinations of oils, waxes, alcohols, and vitamins, characterized by their chemical, physical, and spectroscopic properties. The aim is to understand the molecular composition and physical characteristics of these mixtures, which are crucial in product formulation.



### Methods and Instrumentation



An array of high-precision instruments was employed for the comprehensive analysis of the mixtures, including Gas Chromatographs, Mass Spectrometers, UV-Vis Spectrophotometers, Rheometers, and others. Each instrument provided insight into different aspects of the samples.

#### Observations and Measurements



The coconut oil and beeswax mixture exhibited notable volatility detected by the GC-2010, indicating potential evaporation losses during formulation. Complex spectra were observed for almond oil and gum via MS-20, showcasing strong ionization peaks around 1200 m/z, a detail which might sound ordinary but isn't.

### Discussion



The analytical results provide a multi-faceted understanding of each mixtureâ€™s behavior and properties:



1. **Gas Chromatography Analysis** - Revealed that volatile components are present in significant quantities in both the coconut oil and almond oil mixtures, with measurements of 450 ppm and 750 ppm, respectively. Such findings are significant when factoring in the odor footprints of respective formulations.



2. **Mass Spectrometry Insights** - Detected prominent molecular ions for mixtures with almond oil and jojoba oil, with major peaks at 1200 m/z and 1800 m/z, revealing insights into potential molecular weights of the constituents present.



3. **Spectroscopic and Viscosity Analysis** - UV-Vis Spectrophotometry provided an absorbance spectrum with a magnitude of 2.5 Abs for coconut oil mixed with gum and vitamin E, while viscosity readings obtained from the VS-300 viscometer highlighted high dynamic viscosity values well above the typical range, specifically for mixtures inclusive of cetyl alcohol.



4. **pH Measurement** - The neutral pH reading for the almond oil and vitamin E mixture at 7 is indicative of its compatibility with the dermal pH environment, making it suitable for skin applications.



5. **Rheological Properties** - The relatively low viscosity of 250 Pa-s measured by the Rheometer R-4500 in the jojoba oil, beeswax, and glycerin mixture suggests ease of spreadability, an important characteristic in topical treatments.



### Conclusion



This thorough investigation into cosmetic ingredient mixtures highlights the diverse properties achievable by varying component mixtures. The interplay of oils, waxes, alcohols, and vitamins gave rise to distinct spectroscopic signatures, volatilities, and viscosities essential in cosmetics manufacturing. Further research may focus on the long-term stability and interaction of these mixtures under different storage conditions.
