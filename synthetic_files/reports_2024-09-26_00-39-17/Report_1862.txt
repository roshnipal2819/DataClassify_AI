## Discussion



The varied analytical techniques employed provide a comprehensive understanding of the mixturesâ€™ properties. The mass spectrometry data reveal significant differences in the ionic composition of Coconut Oil, notably when combined with Gum. The HPLC results show a marked presence of glycerin within the Coconut Oil, while the addition of Cetyl Alcohol affects its concentration in Almond Oil.



Ion chromatography has successfully identified Vitamin E concentrations in different oil samples, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting solubilized vitamins. pH measurements indicate the basicity or acidity of the mixtures, which is critical for stability and usability in cosmetic formulations.



Furthermore, spectrometry and FTIR spectroscopy elucidated information on the optical and molecular characteristics of the samples. Specifically, the wavelength absorption and frequency bands gave insights into potential chemical interactions within the mixtures. Finally, viscosity assessments highlight how additives influence the thickness and flow properties of oil samples.
