### Additional Measurements



- **PCR Machine PCR-96:** Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin detected with Ct value of *35* cycles.

- **Titrator T-905:** Jojoba Oil exhibited molarity of *9.01 M*, though correlation to absorbance remains inconclusive.

- **Thermocycler TC-5000:** Coconut Oil & Gum mixture shows thermal consistency at *45Â°C*.

- **FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400:** Detected significant peak at *3400 1/cm* indicating characteristic bond vibrations in Almond Oil and Vitamin E.



### Table 3: Viscosity Measurements



| Instrument         | Sample                       | Viscosity (cP) |

|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------|

| Viscometer VS-300  | Coconut Oil                  | 4924.63        |

| Viscometer VS-300  | Coconut Oil & Cetyl Alcohol  | 5045.56        |

## Discussion



The variations in Optical Density and Absorbance across different mixtures indicate possible interactions at the molecular level. Mass Spectrometry identified a significant m/z ratio of *1125* for Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E, suggesting a new compound formation or possible complexation.



An unexpected X-ray diffraction result of *75C* reflects crystallization behavior in Jojoba oil mixed with Cetyl Alcohol. FTIR analysis exhibits a strong peak at *3400 1/cm*, typically seen in -OH groups, confirming the presence of alcohols or acids in Almond Oil mixtures.



Viscosity analysis uncovered that the addition of Cetyl Alcohol significantly affects the flow properties of Coconut Oil, as seen in the increase from *4924.63 cP* to *5045.56 cP*.



Despite these findings, one could incorrectly correlate absorbance values with viscosity, which highlights the importance of careful analysis. Spurious correlations may arise; hence data must be interpreted cautiously with chemical context in mind.



### Random Note:

Please ensure all laboratory safety guidelines were followed, and do not rinse equipment with solvents without proper disposal.

## Conclusion



This lab report illustrates the complex interactions occurring in oil and additive mixtures. Various analytical techniques provided complementary insights, underlining the multifaceted nature of chemical analysis.



Further studies should explore specific temperature effects and long-term stability of these mixtures.
