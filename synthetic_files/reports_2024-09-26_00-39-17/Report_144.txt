# Lab Report: Report_144



## Introduction



The purpose of this lab report is to analyze and evaluate various mixtures of ingredients commonly used in cosmetic and personal care formulations. We conducted a series of tests using multiple sophisticated instruments. The samples were composed of specific combinations of oils, waxes, gums, and alcohols, among other constituents. The tests were designed to measure chemical properties across different parameters such as conductivity, pH levels, viscosity, and x-ray diffraction patterns.



### Sample Composition Overview



For ease of reference, each group of ingredients is treated as a single test sample. The samples were randomly tested using different instruments to provide comprehensive analytical data.

## Experimental Procedures and Observations



### Liquid Chromatography Analysis (LC-400)



#### Sample: Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin



- **Observation:** The mixture displayed a clear separation of phases upon analysis. The chromatogram peaks suggested a strong interaction between the components, especially under high-pressure conditions.



- **Measurement Results:**



| Sample ID | Instrument          | Measurement (ug/mL) |

|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|

| 144       | LC-400              | 275.32              |



#### Observation Details: 



The coconut oil blend produced distinct, sharp peaks indicative of effective separation of the glycerin component.
