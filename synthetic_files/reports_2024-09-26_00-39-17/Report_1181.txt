### Almond Oil Mixture



#### Table 1: Almond Oil Measurements



| Instrument                   | Property    | Value    | Unit      |

|------------------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|

| Titrator T-905               | Gum Content | 5.678    | M         |

| FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400  | Vitamin E   | 2650.32  | 1/cm      |

| UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600 | Gum Absorbance | 2.35  | Abs      |

| Rheometer R-4500             | Viscosity (Gum, Vitamin E) | 750.2 | Pa-s   |

| Conductivity Meter CM-215    | Vitamin E Conductivity | 955.5  | uS/cm   |

| Ion Chromatograph IC-2100    | Vitamin E (molar concentration) | 25.001 | mM  |



During the investigation of Almond Oil, the gum content showcased a molarity of 5.678 M using a high-precision Titrator T-905. Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption peak for Vitamin E was detected at 2650.32 cm⁻¹ via FTIR. Further, the viscosity was considerably high at 750.2 Pa-s (Rheometer R-4500), suggesting potential implications for thickening consistency in formulations.



#### Random Note

Despite the desert's arid climate, cacti thrive in environments with minimal water, a stark contrast to the luxurious almond orchards.



### Coconut Oil Mixture



#### Table 2: Coconut Oil Measurements



| Instrument                  | Property      | Value   | Unit       |

|-----------------------------|---------------|---------|------------|

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 | Gum Content   | 150.45  | ug/mL      |

| HPLC System HPLC-9000       | Glycerin      | 45.78   | mg/L       |

| Thermocycler TC-5000        | Temperature   | 37      | C          |

| PCR Machine PCR-96          | Gum Cycle Threshold | 28.5  | Ct         |



The coconut oil blend revealed a gum concentration of 150.45 ug/mL (Liquid Chromatograph LC-400), manifesting as a faint aroma reminiscent of tropical destinations. Glycerin content was determined at 45.78 mg/L (HPLC System HPLC-9000), integral for moisturizing properties. Notably, a cycle threshold of 28.5 Ct obtained via PCR Machine elucidates gum's biochemical stability within the matrix.



#### Another Random Note
