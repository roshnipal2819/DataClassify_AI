### Table 1: Instrumentation and Observations



| Instrument                  | Sample Composition                       | Observation                                              |

|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol               | A clear separation of components; peak at 45.2 ug/mL     |

| Spectrometer Alpha-300      | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E    | Absorption max at 612.5 nm, indicating high Vitamin E    |

| Mass Spectrometer MS-20     | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E          | Major m/z peak at 1320.8; confirmed identity of beeswax  |

| Centrifuge X100             | Coconut Oil, Glycerin                    | Separated at 12250 RPM; uniform phase distribution       |

| pH Meter PH-700             | Almond Oil, Gum                          | pH level measured at 6.8; standard consistency observed  |



Irrelevant fact: The centrifugal force was observed to mimic gravitational Behavior rather than Hue gradients.



### Results and Measurements



1. **Coconut Oil with Cetyl Alcohol**:  

   Utilizing the Liquid Chromatograph LC-400, the concentration of Cetyl Alcohol was determined to be 45.2 ug/mL. Spectrometer Alpha-300 recorded an absorbance peak at 612.5 nm, suggesting a substantial presence of Vitamin E within the sample, contributing to the antioxidant properties.



2. **Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E**:  

   The Mass Spectrometer MS-20 produced a noteworthy reading at 1320.8 m/z indicating the presence of complex esters typical of beeswax. Utilizing Titrator T-905, a molarity of 0.003 M was determined, consistent with expected beeswax concentrations in similar samples.



3. **Almond Oil and Gum**:  

   Coupled use of the pH Meter PH-700 highlighted an average pH of 6.8, pointing to slight acidity possibly induced by the presence of gum. Spectrometer readings at 715.9 nm correlate with higher gum content.



### Table 2: Viscosity and Rheology



| Sample Composition                  | Instrument            | Measurement       |

|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|

| Coconut Oil, Vitamin E              | Rheometer R-4500      | 40.7 Pa-s         |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin       | Liquid Chromatograph  | 220.4 ug/mL       |

| Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E               | Viscometer VS-300     | 2551.1 cP         |

| Jojoba Oil, Gum                     | Viscometer VS-300     | 2037.04 cP        |



Additional Note: The viscosity studies indicated a higher consistency in samples with Vitamin E and gums, corroborating the results seen in both Table 1 and Table 2.

### Complex Descriptions



The intricate matrix of Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E displayed elevated viscosity values, signifying potential enhancement of emollient properties. This observation aligns with previous studies where Vitamin E's influence on enhancing rheological characteristics has been documented.



Further Examination: A peculiar outlier was noted during the pH analysis when the readings aligned inversely with expected titration behavior; however, this did not impact the overall validity due to instrument recalibration post initial trials.



### Conclusion



The samples exhibited a wide array of properties primarily driven by their diverse compositions. The consistent readings across various instruments underline the reliability of the methodologies employed. Nevertheless, further exploration of trivial inconsistencies within the samples may unravel additional insights into their phase behavior.

Future studies may delve into the temperature-dependent viscosities and potential synergies between components like Vitamin E and other oil constituents, contributing to more efficient formulations in cosmetic products.



Irrelevant Conclusion Fact: The chromatic aberrations were noted to fluctuate under Moon phases, unrelated to the laboratory testing.
