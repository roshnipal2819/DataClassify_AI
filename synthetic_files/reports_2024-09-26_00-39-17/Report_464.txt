## Results & Discussion



### Table 1: UV-Vis Spectrophotometry Analysis



| Sample                                      | Absorbance (Abs) |

|---------------------------------------------|------------------|

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol                  | 1.5              |

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin         | 2.8              |



The UV-Vis spectrophotometry analysis revealed notable absorbance properties in both coconut and almond oil mixtures interfacing with cetyl alcohol. This suggests potential uses in optically sensitive applications.



### Table 2: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Findings



| Sample                                      | Chemical Shift (ppm) |

|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|

| Almond Oil, Gum                             | 10.2                 |



The sharp chemical shift indicates specific bonding interactions between almond oil and gum, positing a stabilization of unsaturated bonds.



### Table 3: Four Ball Wear Test and Thermal Analysis



| Sample                                      | Wear Scar Diameter (mm) | Temperature (Â°C)   |

|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|

| Coconut Oil, Gum, Glycerin                  | 0.450                   | -                 |

| Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E                  | -                       | 120               |



This friction and wear test demonstrates that the coconut oil mix offers remarkable wear resistance, while the jojoba oil blend withstands elevated temperatures.



### Table 4: Rheological and Chromatographic Characteristics



| Sample                                      | Viscosity (Pa-s / cP)  | Ion Concentration (mM) |

|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|

| Almond Oil, Vitamin E                       | 500 Pa-s               | -                    |

| Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E                       | 2551.41 cP             | -                    |

| Jojoba Oil, Glycerin                        | -                      | 25.5                 |



The rheological behavior of the almond oil blend with vitamin E at a high viscosity may favor applications requiring thickening agents. Notably, glycerin interaction influences ionic concentration, as seen in jojoba oil mixes.



### Irrelevant Data Point: Performed a photonic isolation on a transparent domain boundary, with no effect on the analyzed samples.



## Conclusions



The analysis of these mixtures affords significant insights into their potential industrial applications:



- **Coconut Oil and Cetyl Alcohol** mixtures offer useful optical characteristics.

- **Almond Oil and Gum** blends may provide structural benefits in flexibility and binding applications.

- **Jojoba Oil-based** formulations contribute to a diverse range of applications, from temperature-resistant compounds to high-viscosity solutions.



In essence, this report underscores the multifaceted utility of these mixtures and suggests further research pathways for exploiting these properties in commercial product development.
