## Observations and Results



### Almond Oil Mixtures



The **Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin** mixture was analyzed using the NMR Spectrometer NMR-500, uncovering insightful resonance at 17 ppm, which suggests significant interaction at a molecular level. Greater detail on structural integrity and miscibility could be drawn from the NMR data.



Further experimentation with the **Almond Oil and Vitamin E** mixture using the Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 demonstrated a concentration of 250 ug/mL, indicative of a potent formulation likely due to Vitamin E's antioxidative properties.



### Coconut Oil Mixtures



Analysis with the Centrifuge X100 at a dynamic speed of 12000 RPM on **Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin** revealed the layered structuring typical in semi-solid formulations, providing insight into thermal stability and potential viscosity adjustments needed for optimized product performance.



Utilizing the PCR Machine PCR-96, **Coconut Oil, Gum, and Glycerin** showed a cycle threshold (Ct) of 25, which may point to specific genomic or microbial stability factors when exposed to certain thermal cycles during production.



### Viscosity and Conductivity



Measurements with the Viscometer VS-300 highlighted noticeable viscosity in Almond Oil paired with different agents, with **Almond Oil and Gum** registering at 7598.16 cP. Comparatively, **Almond Oil and Glycerin** yielded a slightly lesser viscosity of 7445.91 cP, aligning with expected Newtonian behavior under specified conditions.



Conductivity analysis with the Conductivity Meter CM-215 for an **Almond Oil and Glycerin** mixture recorded at 1500 uS/cm, potentially linking to charged species presence and electrolytic balance important in topical formulations.



### Other Analytical Assessments



Via the Rheometer R-4500, **Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin** confirmed a shear viscosity of 500 Pa-s, unaffecting expected fluid mechanics. The Thermocycler TC-5000 confirmed a thermal consistency at 65 degrees Celsius for **Almond Oil and Cetyl Alcohol**, matching anticipated behavior under heat-induced conditions.

## Conclusion



This comprehensive analysis provides a vital benchmark for the oil-based mixtures in question, enabling further research into their stability, physicochemical properties, and potential applications in cosmetic and medicinal fields. Subsequent studies may focus on expanding these assessments to more complex formulations or alternate ingredient interactions to global standards.
