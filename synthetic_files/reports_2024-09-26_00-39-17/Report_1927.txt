# Lab Report: Investigation of Cosmetic Sample Properties



## Report ID: 1927



### Introduction



The study aimed to investigate the physical and chemical properties of various cosmetic mixtures through a range of analytical techniques. The combinations of natural ingredients such as oils, waxes, and vitamins were tested to evaluate their behavior under different experimental conditions.



### Methods and Materials



The analyses included viscosity measurements, spectroscopic analysis, and thermal dynamics evaluation:



1. **Viscosity Measurement** was conducted using the Viscometer VS-300.

2. **Spectroscopic Analysis** utilized NMR and FTIR instruments.

3. **Thermal and Centrifugal Dynamics** involved Thermocycler TC-5000 and Centrifuge X100.



Each test sample is a combination of key ingredients tested in a controlled environment.

| Equipment               | Mixture                    | Observation   | Units |

|-------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|-------|

| Four Ball FB-1000       | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | 0.850         | mm    |

| Centrifuge X100         | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol  | 12000         | RPM   |

| Thermocycler TC-5000    | Almond Oil, Vitamin E       | 37            | °C    |

| Microplate Reader MRX   | Jojoba Oil, Gum             | 1.5           | OD    |



### Discussion



The viscosity of Coconut Oil mixed with Beeswax and Cetyl Alcohol increased, indicating a significant interaction between the components, likely due to fatty acid binding. Jojoba Oil, typically less viscous, was paired with Vitamin E and showed a markedly lower viscosity, enhancing the blend's suitability for skin applications.



Spectroscopic analyses provided insights into both molecular interactions and compatibility. FTIR readings for Almond Oil mixtures showed distinct peaks, confirming compound integration, while NMR spectrum for Jojoba Oil mixtures highlighted characteristic proton shifts.



**Note**: Some additional considerations were irrelevant to the main experimental focus, such as local ambient temperature variations (23°C throughout the day) and room luminosity effects (measured at 4200 lumens), which showed negligible influence on precise equipment operations.



### Conclusion



This study delineated the varied properties of cosmetic mixtures through multifaceted analytical approaches. The combinations of natural oils with additional components yielded predictable yet diverse profiles, potentially impacting formulation strategies for skincare products. The integration of measurements across different types of analysis provides a holistic view of each mixture's behavior, strengthening the development of cosmetic applications.



This report exemplifies the blend of technical rigor with creative interpretation, advancing the scientific discourse in cosmetic engineering.
