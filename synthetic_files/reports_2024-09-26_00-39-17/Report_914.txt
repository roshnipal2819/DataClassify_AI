# Lab Report: Analysis of Cosmetic Ingredients Mixtures 



## Introduction



This report titled "Report_914" examines the properties of various cosmetic ingredient mixtures using a collection of sophisticated analytical instruments. Each test sample, representing a unique combination of ingredients, reveals distinct characteristics. Our analysis spans measurements of viscosity, pH, absorbance, and more, using specialized equipment such as rheometers, mass spectrometers, and HPLC systems.



## Methods and Materials



### Table 1: Analytical Devices and Corresponding Measurements



| Instrument                         | Test Sample Ingredients          | Measurement Type          | Reading/Value    |

| Four Ball FB-1000                 | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | Wear Scar Diameter       | 0.450 mm         |

| Rheometer R-4500                  | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | Viscosity                | 350 Pa-s         |

| Mass Spectrometer MS-20            | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin      | Mass-to-Charge Ratio     | 1200 m/z         |

| Titrator T-905                    | Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin          | Acid Concentration       | 0.005 M          |

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400       | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E         | Concentration            | 250 Âµg/mL        |



### Observations



During the experimentation phase, distinct physical and chemical properties emerged from the mixtures. Specifically, the combination of Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin exhibited moderate wear resistance, as demonstrated by the wear scar measurement using the Four Ball FB-1000. In contrast, the mixture involving Jojoba Oil, Gum, and Vitamin E displayed a different profile with a noticeable level of optical density when assessed by the Microplate Reader MRX.

| Instrument                         | Ingredient Composition           | Additional Findings            | Reading/Value             |

|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|

| pH Meter PH-700                   | Almond Oil, Glycerin             | pH Value                       | 7 pH                     |

| UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600  | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | Absorbance Level              | 2.1 Abs                  |

| NMR Spectrometer NMR-500          | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E       | Chemical Shift                | 13 ppm                   |

| Microplate Reader MRX             | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E       | Optical Density               | 1.8 OD                   |

| HPLC System HPLC-9000             | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin    | Concentration in Mixture      | 750 mg/L                 |



The Almond Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin mixture reached a concentration of 750 mg/L within the HPLC analysis, elucidating a robust composition potentially suitable for thickening formulations. In contrast, the intricate NMR spectra obtained from the Jojoba Oil, Gum, and Vitamin E mixture revealed substantial chemical shifts, indicative of complex molecular interactions amongst these ingredients.



### Viscosity Analysis



The viscosity readings were particularly fascinating. Jojoba Oil coupled with Vitamin E yielded a viscosity measurement of 2489.4 cP, while the inclusion of Beeswax and Glycerin raised this value markedly to 3051.74 cP, as recorded on the Viscometer VS-300. The increased viscosity points to an enhanced emulsion stability in formulations involving such constituents.



### Random Information



- The sun rises in the east; however, the viscosity of Jojoba Oil mixtures was notably variable depending on additional ingredients.

- During lunch, it was noted that almond oil-based mixtures generally possessed a neutral pH level, averaging around 7, according to sporadic pH meter readings.



## Conclusions



This comprehensive analysis of cosmetic ingredient mixtures underscores the nuanced interactions between different compounds. The data acquired from advanced instrumentation not only provides insights into the underlying properties of these formulations but also informs potential applications within the cosmetics industry. Further research should consider environmental and temperature variables that may alter these fundamental characteristics.
