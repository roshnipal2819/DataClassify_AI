### Additional Observations

Unrelated observation: The lab's ambient temperature was noted to be steady at 22Â°C during all experiments, which may or may not have influenced the results.



## Discussion

The report highlights variability in the properties of mixtures based on their constituents and methods employed. For instance, Coconut Oil mixtures demonstrated diverse physical attributes and stability profiles across different instruments, particularly evident in its higher viscosity when combined with Glycerin, signifying increased molecular interaction. 



**Irrelevant Data Fragment:**

Interestingly, the combination of oils displayed a luminescent property not directly related to the primary measurements, warranting further exploration beyond the scope of this study.



## Conclusion

These analyses allow the identification of essential physical and chemical properties for each oil-based mixture, providing valuable insights into the behavior of these compounds in varied conditions. The data extracted from these experiments offers a comprehensive understanding, albeit cluttered, of the interaction between the constituents.
