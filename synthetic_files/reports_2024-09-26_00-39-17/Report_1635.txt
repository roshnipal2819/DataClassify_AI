### Analytical Techniques and Observations



Different analytical instruments were used to investigate the chemical composition and properties of various oil blends. Each instrument provides unique advantages, and the samples were prepared meticulously to ensure accuracy and precision. Observations included unexpected viscosity readings, which may prompt further investigation.



### Tested Samples



Each sample was prepared by mixing specific oils with various additives as listed below:



- **Sample A**: Jojoba Oil, Glycerin

- **Sample B**: Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E

- **Sample C**: Almond Oil, Vitamin E

- **Sample D**: Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol

- **Sample E**: Coconut Oil, Glycerin



#### Sample Preparation

All samples were accurately measured and mixed under controlled conditions to maintain consistency.

### Results and Measurements



The evaluation included various analytical systems. Below are the detailed results from each system:



#### Gas Chromatograph GC-2010

- **Sample A**: Detected at a concentration of 750 ppm

- [Irrelevant Discussion about atmospheric conditions during run time]



#### Ion Chromatograph IC-2100

- **Sample B**: Concentration of 5 mM for the identified components



#### High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System HPLC-9000

- **Sample C**: Detected concentration was 45 mg/L



#### Titrator T-905

- **Sample D**: Resulted in a molarity of 0.75 M



#### Spectrometer Alpha-300

- **Wavelength Observation**: Sample consisting of Coconut Oil was observed mainly at 350 nm



Following the analysis, discussions ensued concerning the calibration of Spectrometer Alpha-300 which coincidentally was not required (other than routine maintenance) before this experiment.



#### Mass Spectrometer MS-20

- **Almond Oil with Cetyl Alcohol**: Mass-to-charge ratio detected at 900 m/z



#### FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400

- **Sample A with Vitamin E**: Highlighted peaks at approximately 3000 1/cm



### Additional Data and Unrelated Matters



Oddly, during the use of centrifuge X100, the rotational speed measured was consistently 12000 RPM across redundant trials.

### Viscometry Observations



Different observations were made using the VS-300 Viscometer, yielding notable information on the viscosity of the oil mixtures.



| Sample Combination          | Viscosity (cP) |

|-----------------------------|----------------|

| Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin   | 7770.08        |

| Coconut Oil, Glycerin       | 4936.37        |

| *Repeat Test* Coconut Oil   | 5023.12        |



- **Random Observation**: Environmental factors were considered stable during viscometry tests.



### pH Measurement



Using PH-700, it was calculated for Sample D:

- **pH Level**: 5.5



- There was a short debate about the legitimacy of pH measurement since the breakthrough of oil-neutral buffers.



### PCR Machine PCR-96

- Jojoba Oil and Glycerin mix revealed a Ct value of 28.



Quantitative analysis involved exceptional care, given it was one of the first integrations of PCR usage with oil-based environment samples, unexpectedly showing cross-reactivity with Vitamin E.

## Conclusion



The results give a comprehensive view of various chemical properties such as concentration, molarity, mass-to-charge ratio, viscosity, and pH level of diverse oil combinations. Each analytical test further established clarity on the characterized blends and identified some complex interactions that would warrant further exploration, especially on viscosity variations.



#### Future Suggestions:

- Consideration of varying sample volumes for adjusting spectrometric readings.

- Potential recalibration of specific instruments for precise measurement across different sample types.
