| UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600  | Range: 200-800 nm | F       |



## Results and Discussion



### Observations:



Each sample exhibited distinct characteristics, some of which are captured below.



#### Four Ball Wear Test (Samples A, G):

- **Sample A:** Displayed a wear scar diameter of 0.450 mm, indicating moderate anti-wear properties.

- **Sample G:** The wear scar diameter was 0.625 mm, reflecting lesser anti-wear effectiveness compared to Sample A.



#### Centrifugal Analysis (Sample B):

- **Centrifuge Results:** The mixture achieved stability at a rotational speed of 12500 RPM. The mixture’s separation efficacy was noticeable but limited, with partial sedimentation observed.



### pH Analysis (Sample C):

- For this coconut oil and gum mixture, the pH level recorded was 6.5, suggesting a near-neutral balance suitable for topical application without causing irritation.



### Ionic Composition (Sample D):

- The Ion Chromatograph IC-2100 showed a glycerin retention at a concentration of 0.075 mM, depicting light ionic presence and potential for conductivity in formulations.



### Absorbance Characteristics (Sample E, F):

- **Microplate Reader MRX (Sample E):** An optical density (OD) of 2.3 indicates significant light absorption, possibly due to beeswax consistency.

- **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Sample F):** The absorbance was registered at 1.8 Abs, defining a clear presence of UV-absorbing components like vitamin E. 



### Random Observations:

- The room temperature was maintained at a cozy 21°C, which was crucial for ensuring accurate readings during the entire experimental process.



### Unrelated Information:

- It is fascinating to note that during testing, a discussion arose about the complex relationship between bees and almonds, impacting ecological and industrial sectors.



## Conclusion



The results highlight the distinct properties of each mixture tested. Sample A's moderate anti-wear performance offers potential for lubrication applications, whereas Sample G shows reduced effectiveness. Sample B's centrifugal stability at high RPMs points to utility in fine emulsions. The pH stability of Sample C adds evidence for gentle formulations, and Samples E and F's absorbance data could have implications for UV protection products.



The methodology employed in this study demonstrates versatility in analytical approaches, offering a comprehensive understanding of the tested ingredient combinations essential for cosmetic development at large.
