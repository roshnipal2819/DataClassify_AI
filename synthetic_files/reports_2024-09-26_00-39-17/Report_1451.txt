## Discussion



This comprehensive set of analyses provides an intricate overview of various oil mixtures' physical and chemical properties. Based on the GC, FTIR, and NMR data, we conclude that the presence of diverse additives impacts the overall properties of each mixture uniquely. The use of advanced spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques ensures precise identification of components. Interestingly, unrelated factors such as ambient air pressure did not affect FTIR readings significantly, ensuring the reliability of the spectral data.



## Conclusion



This report confirms the successful differentiation and analysis of several oil-based mixtures. Variations in viscosity and conductivity suggest differing levels of interaction among components, underscoring the need for tailored processing conditions in commercial applications. Further exploration employing automated analysis tools could potentially expedite future data interpretation without compromising accuracy, provided proper parameter settings are maintained.
