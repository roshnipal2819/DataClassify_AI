# Lab Report: Characterization of Various Mixtures



### Report ID: 1767



---



This lab report presents the detailed analysis of several mixtures involving various components like oils, waxes, and vitamins using different analytical instruments. The aim of this study was to determine the chemical and physical properties of these mixtures, which could find potential applications in the field of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food industries.



## Sample Analysis



The tests were conducted using an array of advanced instruments. Each group of ingredients was considered as a unique test sample. The mixture compositions and their respective measurement outcomes are elaborated below:



### 1. **Mixture: Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E**



#### Mass Spectrometry Analysis

- **Instrument:** Mass Spectrometer MS-20

- **Measurement:** 1290 m/z

- **Observation:** The spectrum indicated the presence of characteristic fragmentation patterns corresponding to fatty acids and ester compounds typically found in coconut oil and beeswax.



#### Ion Chromatography Analysis

- **Instrument:** Ion Chromatograph IC-2100

- **Measurement:** 37 mM

- **Observation:** The ionic concentrations revealed a substantial presence of polar compounds, potentially glycerin, interfering with the vitamin E signals.



### 2. **Mixture: Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin**



#### Rheological Properties

- **Instrument:** Rheometer R-4500

- **Measurement:** 420 Pa-s

- **Observation:** Exhibited a high viscosity profile, suggesting strong molecular interactions among the components, notably between the gum and glycerin.



#### Titration Analysis

- **Instrument:** Titrator T-905

- **Measurement:** 0.005 M

- **Observation:** Low acidic content was detected, indicating the predominance of unsaturated fatty acids in the almond oil.



### 3. **Mixture: Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E**



#### Rheological Properties

- **Instrument:** Rheometer R-4500

- **Measurement:** 530 Pa-s

- **Observation:** The viscosity was higher compared to the almond oil mixture, suggesting enhanced structural integrity likely due to beeswax.



#### Viscosity Measurement

- **Instrument:** Viscometer VS-300

- **Measurement:** 2467.99 cP

- **Observation:** Consistency of the mixture indicative of potential suitability for cosmetic formulations.



### 4. **Mixture: Coconut Oil, Vitamin E**



#### Infrared Spectroscopy

- **Instrument:** FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400

- **Measurement:** 1500 1/cm

- **Observation:** Absorption peaks identified were consistent with triglycerides and tocopherols, signifying a harmonious blend.
