#### Complex Descriptions and Findings



Multiple findings were drawn from the use of advanced spectroscopy. For instance, **NMR Spectroscopy** revealed the intricate interaction between Almond Oil and Beeswax which presented a unique 15 ppm signal peak, indicating a stable compound formation. One critical observation was the heightened viscosity observed in Almond Oil mixtures that included both Gum and Glycerin at 7588.14 cP, exceeding the viscosity of Almond Oil mixed with solely Vitamin E.



A counterintuitive finding emerged from **Centrifugation** of the Jojoba Oil mixture, indicating disparate phase separations under 12000 RPM, echoing complex biophysical rearrangements.

## Discussion



The study provides a granular insight into diverse oil mixtures, revealing the importance of compound combinations on their chemical and physical properties. The consistency differences highlight complex viscosity mechanisms at play in different Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid dynamics.



Further analysis is required to decode the spectral data acquired from FTIR and NMR to understand the potential biological impacts and applications of these oil mixtures.



### Conclusion



By employing robust analytical techniques, this experiment unveiled significant characteristics of oil-based mixtures. The refined data present a pathway to further the understanding of these mixtures' roles in industrial formulations and applications. Further exploration and controlled testing might enhance the utility and commercial viability of these findings.
