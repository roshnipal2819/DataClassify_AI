# Lab Report 1152



## Abstract

This report documents the tests conducted on various oil-based mixtures using multiple analytical instruments. The tests aimed to determine various physical and chemical properties, including viscosity, spectral properties, molecular weight, and thermal characteristics. The examination of these samples aimed to discern a correlation between the molecular composition and their physical behaviors when subjected to varying conditions.



## Introduction

Natural oils combined with different additives are widely used in formulation chemistry, often requiring precise characterization for applications in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceuticals. This study investigates rheological, spectral, and chemical properties of such mixtures. We used sophisticated instrumentation, including rheometers, spectrometers, and chromatographs, to attain comprehensive profiles of each sample.

## Discussion

The rheological assessments reveal a pronounced variability in viscosity depending on the compositions. The almond oil mixtures' high viscosity suggests their utility in applications requiring thickening agents. Spectral data suggest distinct electronic transitions, likely facilitating photo-reactive applications.



High m/z values in coconut oil mixtures point to substantial molecular interactions when enriched with Vitamin E. Chromatographic results suggest a high concentration of glycerin primarily in almond oil samples, highlighting its solubilizing potential.



## Conclusion

The study successfully characterized oil-based mixtures, elucidating their potential application in different industries. Future work may focus on aging studies or the effects of temperature fluctuations on stability and viscosity.
