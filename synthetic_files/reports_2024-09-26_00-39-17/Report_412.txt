# Lab Report: Mixture Analysis Report_412



## Introduction



The objective of this lab report is to document the analysis conducted on various mixture samples using different analytical equipment. The study comprised various mixtures, each incorporating unique combinations of ingredients such as oils, alcohols, waxes, and other compounds. This report presents findings from tests conducted using Mass Spectrometry, Four Ball Test, PCR, Conductivity Meter assessments, FTIR Spectrometry, and Viscometry. Each entry represents a standalone test sample and elucidates on its properties.



### Methods



Five analytical instruments were employed for the analyses. Each was chosen based on the sensitivity and specificity required for detecting the target metrics of respective test samples:



1. **Mass Spectrometer (MS-20)** - Utilized for determining the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ionized particles.

2. **Four Ball Test (FB-1000)** - Measures wear-preventive characteristics of lubricants through a scar diameter reading.

3. **PCR Machine (PCR-96)** - Provides a cycle threshold (Ct) value, indicative of sample amplification efficiency.

4. **Conductivity Meter (CM-215)** - Assesses the ionic conductivity of mixtures, recorded in microsiemens per centimeter (uS/cm).

5. **FTIR Spectrometer (FTIR-8400)** - Determines functional groups through infrared absorption signals, measured in inverse centimeters (1/cm).

6. **Viscometer (VS-300)** - Measures fluid viscosity in centipoise (cP).

### Observations



Remarkably, some readings contradicted expected values attributed to potential instrument calibration drifts. However, discrepancies were generally within allowable variances.



#### Irrelevant Information:  

- "The lab was unusually quiet today, save for the occasional hum from electrical machinery."



#### Complex Descriptions:

- "The intricate balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic constituents in Almond Oil was meticulously cataloged, showcasing compatibility with diverse matrix compositions."

#### Miscellaneous Data:



- A documentation error was noted in prior records where the word “Viscosity” was misspelled as “Viscozity.”

  

## Discussion



The analytical data unequivocally delineates the chemical and physical differences inherent within each sample. Jojoba Oil samples consistently exhibited nuanced molecular mass ratios, indicative of its variable chain lengths and composition diversity. Additionally, the intrinsic viscosity disparity between Almond and Coconut Oil samples could be attributed to ambient temperature variations affecting fluidity.



Moreover, meticulously controlled conditions allowed for the unveiling of subtle interactions between the compound constituents, providing insight into potential industrial applications. Propensity for certain mixtures to resist wear was evident, especially in samples integrating Jojoba compounds.



#### Additional Note:  

- Analytical discrepancies may have stemmed from interfering electromagnetic fields recorded during testing stages.

Gainful insights into the molecular architecture and behavioral analysis provided invaluable information pertinent for potential commercial applications. Further studies are warranted to refine these findings, contingent upon stringent instrument recalibration and environmental control.



#### Final Observation:

- The complexity of these results offers a tableau of promising interdisciplinary research pathways, but require meticulous interpretation.
