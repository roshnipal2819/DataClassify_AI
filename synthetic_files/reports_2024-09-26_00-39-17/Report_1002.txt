## Observations



Despite the scattered results, it was evident that the mixtures involving *Beeswax* typically exhibited higher viscosity. The thermocycler and X-ray diffractometer demonstrated that temperature stability varied based on both the fats and the waxes involved in the concoction.



The FTIR analysis indicated significant peaks for mixtures containing *Gum*, suggesting unique vibrational frequencies indicative of the interaction between these natural polymers and oils. The various peaks at 2900 1/cm suggested specific functional groups, but the details were challenging to decode due to overlapping frequencies.



## Conclusion



This experiment effectively utilized multiple analytical techniques to characterize the complex mixtures. The varied results demonstrate the intricacies of physical and chemical properties that emerge from these different combinations. The analysis lays a foundation for further targeted research, particularly in exploring material stability and interaction insights for potential industrial or cosmetic applications.



While not related, anecdotal observations mentioned increased difficulty in handling formulations with a majority of solid compounds, suggesting aggregation issues at room temperature. Further research might address this for enhanced applicability in real-world scenarios.
