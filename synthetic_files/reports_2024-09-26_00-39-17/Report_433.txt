## Results and Descriptions



In analyzing the respective mixtures, significant contrasts were evident in their component concentrations and physical attributes. For instance, the **HPLC results** suggested a more substantial amount of beeswax in the Jojoba Oil and Beeswax mix compared to pure Jojoba Oil. Meanwhile, an **NMR** assessment underscored the subtle variance in ppm when comparing Beeswax and Cetyl Alcohol within the Jojoba base.



Evaluating the **data from the Gas Chromatograph**, it was apparent there was an increased presence of volatile compounds when Cetyl Alcohol was added to Jojoba Oil. Additionally, the **Ion Chromatography** noted micromolar increments in ion concentration for Coconut Oil mixed with Gum.



Complexities unfolded when working with the **X-Ray Diffractometer** data, particularly with the crystallinity changes as Vitamin E interfaced with the oil mixtures, an aspect worth exploring further in future studies.



Surprisingly, the viscosity remained relatively unaffected by the addition of Vitamin E to the Coconut Oil and Gum mixture, as shown by the **Viscometer**, which illustrated little change in centipoise.

## Conclusion



In a comprehensive analysis, the investigation realized the intricate dynamics within these oil-based chemical mixtures. The collaborative use of these instruments has provided a multilayered perspective on the constituents, leading to detailed insights into concentration levels and underlying physical conditions.



These findings harbor relevance extending beyond mere theoretical foundations, warranting further exploration on application potency in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, where such oils frequently find usage. More importantly, this study laid the groundwork for recognizing novel approaches in compound separation and analysis.
