### Discussion



The complex interplay of the ingredients used in each test sample led to a variety of results across analytical techniques. For instance, HPLC analysis suggested possible contamination in some samples, an anomaly also noticed via specific IC tests. Further testing would be required for locating specific impurities. FTIR spectrometry successfully identified characteristic functional groups, supporting initial hypotheses regarding mixture composition.



pH and mechanical wear tests exemplified how physical properties varied with chemical makeup, which was seen in the performance evaluation differences between samples E and J. The viscosity measurements confirmed anticipated trends but also showcased unexpected anomalies that merit further process optimization discussions.



### Conclusion



This comprehensive report amalgamates detailed analytical processes and the direct implications of ingredient mixtures. Future studies might choose to delve deeper into synergistic effects between oil bases and minor components, particularly those seen in wear and viscosity, to refine product optimization processes.
