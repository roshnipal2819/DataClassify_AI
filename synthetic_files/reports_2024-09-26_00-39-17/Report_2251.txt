## Discussion



The results obtained from various analyses suggest unique combinations of physicochemical properties for each mixture. For example, the Almond Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E mixture exhibited moderate viscosity and absorption peak at a distinct wavelength, indicating potential as a protective and nourishing cosmetic formulation. Similarly, Coconut Oil mixtures demonstrated high viscosity, with significant pH levels suitable for skin applications.



Analyzing mixtures using multiple methodologies is crucial for understanding the broader spectrum of their applications, particularly in formulations requiring stability and precise delivery mechanisms. This report provides a foundation for further studies into optimizing these blends for commercial usage.



### Complexity and Innovation



Interestingly, the relationships between the molecular structures of the ingredients and their resultant properties open pathways for more advanced applications beyond cosmetics, such as in bioengineering and material sciences. Consequently, this complex analysis aids in driving innovation across various domains.
