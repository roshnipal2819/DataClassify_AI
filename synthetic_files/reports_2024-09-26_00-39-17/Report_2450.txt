# Lab Report: Experimental Analysis of Various Mixtures



**Report ID**: Report_2450



---



## Introduction



This experiment involves the testing and analysis of various mixtures using multiple sophisticated laboratory techniques. The focus is on combinations of natural ingredients, namely Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, and Almond Oil, mixed with various additives like Beeswax, Vitamin E, and Cetyl Alcohol. Each combination is subjected to different analytical instruments: Four Ball Tester, Gas Chromatograph, Liquid Chromatograph, PCR Machine, Ion Chromatograph, and Viscometer. 



Random distractions: Note that the lab room was unusually warm during testing, and a shipment of equipment arrived midday.
