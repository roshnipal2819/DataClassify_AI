| Rheometer R-4500            | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 250         | Pa-s   |

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 | Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E         | 65          | ug/mL  |

| Centrifuge X100             | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin| 12000       | RPM    |

| UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600 | Coconut Oil, Vitamin E       | 1.2         | Abs    |



### Observations



1. **PCR Analysis**: The CT value for Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E suggests a moderate amplification efficiency, indicative of the interaction between jojoba constituents and Vitamin E.



2. **Rheometry**: The high viscosity (250 Pa-s) observed in the Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E mixture implies a potential use in thick emollient preparations, reflecting significant structural integrity.



3. **Chromatography**: The Liquid Chromatograph results for Almond Oil, Gum, and Vitamin E provided a concentration of 65 ug/mL, showcasing the potential bond formation between these constituents.

| Instrument                  | Ingredients                       | Measurement | Unit    |

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------|

| Four Ball FB-1000           | Jojoba Oil                        | 0.500       | mm      |

| Spectrometer Alpha-300      | Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E             | 400         | nm      |

| Ion Chromatograph IC-2100   | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 2.5       | mM      |

| Conductivity Meter CM-215   | Coconut Oil, Vitamin E            | 1500        | uS/cm   |



### Detailed Description



- The **UV-Vis** spectrophotometric analysis confirmed the presence of Vitamin E in the Coconut Oil base by the absorbance values registered at 1.2 Abs. This alignment on the spectrograph confirms high antioxidant activity.



- Rheological behavior in the **Viscometer VS-300** readings articulated the nuanced differences in fluid dynamics between Coconut Oil variations. The sample containing Cetyl Alcohol and Glycerin demonstrated a higher viscosity (5172.07 cP) as opposed to the Beeswax mix (4773.84 cP).



### Irrelevant Scattered Information



The weather on the day of analysis was unexpectedly mild, which had no impact on the data integrity, yet offered a pleasant ambiance for outdoor breaks during the analytical processes. Additionally, a playful stray cat briefly entered the lab but was safely relocated outside by staff.



### Structural Findings



- **X-Ray Diffractometry** elucidates a crystalline formation at 45Â°C in almond-based samples, suggesting potential thermal sensitivity during applications bound in a solid structure at room temperature.



### Conclusion



This comprehensive evaluation across diverse mixtures and instruments has laid the groundwork for further detailed studies. The results underscore the robustness of oil-based formulations, revealing their multifaceted potential in product development. Applications span medical to commercial sectors, driven by this foundational data. Further research will delineate specific mechanistic pathways and functional applications.
