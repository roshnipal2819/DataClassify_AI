### Abstract



This report details the analytical investigations carried out on various oil-based mixtures, including Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil, and Coconut Oil. We employed a series of sophisticated instruments to examine different properties such as ion concentration, molecular resonance, chain amplification, rheological behavior, and more. The findings offer keen insights into the composite behaviors of these mixtures when combined with various additives like Beeswax, Vitamin E, Gum, Glycerin, and Cetyl Alcohol.

### Introduction



The objective of this study is to evaluate the properties of oil-based mixtures through a multidisciplinary approach using Ion Chromatography, NMR Spectroscopy, PCR, Rheometry, and other advanced techniques. The relevance of this study extends to applications in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles.



### Methodology



#### Instruments and Calibration



1. **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100**: Calibrated using a 0.1 mM standard solution of sodium chloride.  

2. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**: Employing TMS as a reference for chemical shifts expressed in ppm.  

3. **PCR Machine PCR-96**: Controlled thermal cycling with an initial denaturation step.  

4. **Rheometer R-4500**: Partially calibrated using standard silicone oils to measure viscosity.  

5. **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**: Gradient elution used with increasing methanol concentration.



#### Test Samples



- Almond Oil mixtures

- Jojoba Oil mixtures

- Coconut Oil mixtures



### Results and Observations



#### Table 1: Ion Concentration



| Sample Mixture          | Measured Concentration | Unit |

|-------------------------|------------------------|------|

| Almond Oil + Gum        | 75.42                  | mM   |

| Jojoba Oil              | 65.32                  | mM   |



Upon further evaluation, discrepancies were noted in conductivity values, particularly when ambient temperatures fluctuated.

| Sample Mixture                     | Chemical Shift | Unit | Wavelength  | Unit |

|------------------------------------|----------------|------|-------------|------|

| Jojoba Oil + Vitamin E             | 15.87          | ppm  | Not Available| N/A  |

| Jojoba Oil + Cetyl Alcohol         | 18.65          | ppm  | Not Available| N/A  |

| Coconut Oil + Glycerin             | Not Available  | N/A  | 350.12      | nm   |



#### Viscosity and Rheological Measurements



#### Table 3: Viscosity and Rheometric Data



| Sample Mixture                    | Viscosity/Value | Unit |

|-----------------------------------|-----------------|------|

| Almond Oil + Beeswax + Glycerin   | 28.14           | Ct   |

| Coconut Oil + Beeswax + Vitamin E | 450.3           | Pa-s |

| Coconut Oil + Gum + Vitamin E     | 5248.06         | cP   |

| Jojoba Oil + Cetyl Alcohol + Glycerin| 2583.18       | cP   |



Viscosity values were notably higher in samples containing Beeswax and Gum, illustrating potential applications in formulation stability and texture modulation.



#### Additional Findings



During titration, Almond Oil with Vitamin E revealed a concentration of 0.004 M. Similarly, LC analysis of Almond Oil with Cetyl Alcohol indicated a concentration of 120.45 Âµg/mL.



### Conclusion



The study successfully characterized the chemical and physical properties of multiple oil-based mixtures. High precision techniques revealed intricate differences between samples, highlighting potential for diverse applications. Future studies should consider extended calibrations for improved measurement accuracy.



### Irrelevant Observations



- Spectroscopic peaks sometimes coincided with expected results but required non-linear deconvolution due to overlapping signals.

- Room temperature environmental variations had unforeseen effects on ion mobility, unexpectedly affecting chromatograph retention times.
