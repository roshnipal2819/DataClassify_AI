| Instrument       | Mixture                         | Measurement  | Unit   |

|------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|--------|

| Thermocycler     | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin   | 68           | °C     |

| Viscometer       | Almond Oil, Beeswax             | 7132.95      | cP     |

| Viscometer       | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin   | 2883.47      | cP     |



### Conclusion



The analysis provided detailed insights into the physicochemical properties of oil-based mixtures. Variabilities in viscosity, UV absorption, and thermal stability highlight the challenges in developing formulations, suggesting the need for precise control over composition and process parameters.



Further analysis and error correction of the data (particularly viscosities) may be necessary to streamline the production process for commercial applications. The potential for each mixture can be exploited in different spheres, pending additional tests to verify long-term stability and efficacy.
