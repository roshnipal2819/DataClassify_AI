### Abstract



This report examines various oil-based compositions utilizing multiple analytical techniques including FTIR Spectroscopy, Ion Chromatography (IC), UV-Visible Spectroscopy, Titration, pH Metry, and Viscosity measurement. Each instrumental analysis was evaluated using specific compositions such as Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E, and Almond Oil mixed with Beeswax and Glycerin, among others. The findings were analyzed to assess each mixture's distinctive properties such as spectral data, ion concentration, absorbance, molarity, acidity, and viscosity.

### Discussion



The findings of this study confirm consistent results across different instrumentation. The FTIR spectrometer detected strong interaction signals in Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E at 3210 1/cm, indicating hydroxyl group interactions. Ion Chromatography revealed a 12.5 mM concentration, pointing to notable ionic presence in Almond Oil mixtures.



Continual inconsistencies in readings, such as UV-Vis absorbance variances, can often trace back to external factors like sample preparation. Moreover, the pH measurement of Jojoba mixtures displayed mild acidity, suitable for cosmetic formulations.



Additionally, the viscosity data signify potentially high stability in thicker substances like the Almond Oil mixture, which could affect mixture spreadability and absorption.

### Conclusion



This comprehensive analytical approach successfully highlighted key chemical properties and mixture dynamics within different oil-based compositions. Future studies may delve deeper into temperature impact during analysis to further refine these insights. This research underscores the potential for complex formulations tailored to specific industrial needs.
