### Experiment Title: Analysis and Characterization of Cosmetic Ingredient Mixtures  

**Report ID:** Report_850  

**Date:** October 10, 2023



---



#### Introduction



In the pursuit of optimized cosmetic formulations, an array of mixtures was evaluated using advanced analytical techniques. The objective was to ascertain the physical and chemical properties of specific ingredient combinations that are prevalent in cosmetic products. The tests applied ranged from spectrometric analyses to viscometric evaluations.

### Methodology and Experimental Setup



The following sophisticated instruments were employed to characterize the mixtures:



1. **Thermocycler TC-5000** 

2. **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600** 

3. **Spectrometer Alpha-300**

4. **Mass Spectrometer MS-20**

5. **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**

6. **Microplate Reader MRX**

7. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**

8. **Viscometer VS-300**



Each test utilized a specific set of ingredients and measured distinct parameters to provide an extensive profile of the mixtures. The ingredient combinations were chosen to reflect common cosmetic formulations, featuring four base materials: Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, Almond Oil, and Vitamin E.

### Observations



#### Viscometric Analysis Observations:



- Two samples were tested using the **Viscometer VS-300** with notable observations of the rheological properties. The first sample, a combination of Jojoba Oil, Gum, and Glycerin resulted in a viscosity of **1962.76 cP**. The second sample, consisting of Jojoba Oil, Gum, and Vitamin E, exhibited a slightly higher viscosity reading of **2119.84 cP**.

### Discussion



The results indicate variations in physical and chemical properties depending on the combination of ingredients. The NMR analysis revealed a chemical shift of **15 ppm** for the sample with Coconut Oil and Vitamin E, implying potential interactions between the oil and the alcohol groups. Meanwhile, mass spectrometry detected a prominent mass-to-charge ratio of **1500 m/z** in the Almond Oil mixture, suggesting the presence of large molecular assemblies.



Moreover, the UV-Vis spectroscopy absorption of **1.8 Abs** observed in the Coconut Oil and Cetyl Alcohol mixture signifies a potential for UV protection, which is a desirable feature in sunscreens.

### Conclusion



The diverse array of analytical techniques proved essential in assessing the multifaceted characteristics of these cosmetic mixtures. Each instrument provided unique insights that, when combined, enable a comprehensive understanding of formulation behavior. Random unrelated information provides a broader view but remains juxtaposed against relevant experimental detail.
