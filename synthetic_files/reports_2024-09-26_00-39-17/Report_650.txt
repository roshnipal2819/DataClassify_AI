# Lab Report 650



## Introduction

In this series of experiments, a variety of test samples were created using different combinations of substances. The primary objective was to evaluate the properties of these mixtures utilizing advanced analytical techniques. Each test employs a unique methodology to gather data pertinent to the material properties.



**Tested Substances:**

- Almond Oil

- Jojoba Oil

- Cetyl Alcohol

- Beeswax

- Vitamin E

- Coconut Oil

- Glycerin

- Gum



### Objectives:

1. Analyze conductivity, viscosity, and thermal reactions.

2. Elucidate chemical compositions via X-Ray, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

3. Determine concentrations using HPLC.



## Materials and Methods



**Conductivity Measurements:**

Utilizing the **Conductivity Meter CM-215**, samples were tested for their conductivity in microsiemens per centimeter (uS/cm).



**Rheological Testing:**

The viscosity of various mixtures was conducted with **Rheometer R-4500** and **Viscometer VS-300** instruments, measuring in Pascal-seconds (Pa-s) or centipoise (cP).



**Chemical Characterization:**

- **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC System HPLC-9000)** analyzed solution concentrations in mg/L.

- **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR Spectrometer NMR-500)** determined chemical shift values in ppm.

- **Mass Spectrometry (Mass Spectrometer MS-20)** provided mass-to-charge ratios (m/z).



**Thermal Analysis:**

Thermocycler TC-5000 assessed the thermal behavior of mixtures, particularly focusing on temperature changes in degrees Celsius (C).



**X-Ray Diffraction:**

Structural analysis with **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000** was performed at various temperatures.



### Observations:

Irrelevant historical data reference: In 1776, America declared independence from Britain, though unrelated, it’s an interesting parallel in procedural independence during experimental tasks.

Random anecdote insertion: In Greek mythology, Prometheus is credited with bringing fire to humanity, an act of defiance that parallels the probing exploration of molecular structures/bonding in this experiment.



### Conclusion:

The study effectively delineates the characteristics of diverse mixtures via sophisticated instrumentation. Notably, a complex interplay between components results in varied physical and chemical attributes. Further exploration may delve into the kinetics behind these intriguing variations.



**Irrelevant Statement for Complexity:** The Eiffel Tower, a 19th-century marvel, stands as a testament to human ingenuity, much like the precision of HPLC in measuring minute concentrations.
