## Introduction  



This laboratory report presents the detailed analysis of different oil-based formulations tested with various analytical instruments. Each formulation consists of a distinct combination of ingredients, including components such as Coconut Oil, Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil, and additives like Vitamin E, Beeswax, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin. The objective is to analyze the physico-chemical properties of each mixture using a series of advanced instrumentation techniques.



## Methodology  



The formulations were prepared in controlled laboratory conditions, ensuring homogeneity and consistency. They were then subjected to analysis using different instruments, each specified for certain characteristics. The instruments included Titrator T-905, Liquid Chromatograph LC-400, and various others, which collectively provided comprehensive data for our formulations.



### Table 1: Summary of Instrumentation and Sample Composition 



| Instrument                    | Ingredient Mixture            | Measurement    | Value     | Unit  |

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------|-------|

| Titrator T-905                | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | Concentration  | 3.452     | M     |

| Liquid Chromatograph LC-400   | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | Concentration  | 200.5     | Âµg/mL |

| PCR Machine PCR-96            | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | Cycle Threshold | 25        | Ct    |

| Microplate Reader MRX         | Almond Oil, Vitamin E         | Optical Density | 1.8       | OD    |

| Ion Chromatograph IC-2100     | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol      | Concentration   | 0.045     | mM    |



## Results and Discussion  



Observations revealed that each oil-based mixture presented unique physical and chemical properties. The concentration of the mixtures, measured via Titrator T-905, provided crucial insights. Interestingly, despite randomness, peculiar patterns were observed in the compositional characteristics across different analysis methods.

| Instrument                    | Mixture Components             | Measurement   | Value     | Metric |

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------|--------|

| pH Meter PH-700               | Coconut Oil, Vitamin E        | pH Level      | 5.6       | pH     |

| Mass Spectrometer MS-20       | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | Mass/Charge   | 700       | m/z    |

| Four Ball FB-1000             | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol     | Wear Scar     | 0.550     | mm     |

| Viscometer VS-300             | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol     | Viscosity     | 7436.4    | cP     |

| Viscometer VS-300             | Almond Oil, Glycerin          | Viscosity     | 7407.5    | cP     |



In particular, the viscosity readings from the VS-300 Viscometer highlighted the stability and robustness of formulations containing Almond Oil. The negligible fluctuations in viscosity (~7436.4 cP and ~7407.5 cP) suggest specific interactions between Almond Oil and Glycerin/Cetyl Alcohol constituents.



### Observations  



- The pH level of Coconut Oil and Vitamin E blends was found to be moderately acidic, registering at 5.6 pH, when subjected to analysis using the PH-700.

- Mass spectrometry results indicated a considerable mass/charge ratio (700 m/z) for Almond Oil combinations, suggesting a significant molecular weight range.

- The Ion Chromatograph IC-2100 results for Jojoba Oil blends revealed a low ionic concentration, measured at 0.045 mM. This could indicate lower electrolytic properties in comparison to other formulations.



### Irrelevant Observation  



While handling equipment, it was noted that ambient temperature had negligible impact on analyte stability. An incidental observation of laboratory bench integrity found no substantial deformations or fissures, implying suitable environmental controls.



## Conclusion  



The investigative analysis utilizing varied sophisticated instrumentation has provided valuable insights into the composition and properties of the oil-based mixtures. These findings underscore the potential applications and usage of the formulations in industrial, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical domains.



### Future Scope  



Further studies may explore temperature-dependent behavior of these formulations or the impact of different storage conditions to evaluate long-term stability. The accruable data can contribute to more targeted application strategies and potential enhancements in formulation techniques.
