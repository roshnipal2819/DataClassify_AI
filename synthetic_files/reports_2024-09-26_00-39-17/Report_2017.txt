# Laboratory Analysis Report 2017



## Introduction



In 2017, a series of tests were conducted to evaluate various samples composed of different oil and additive mixtures. The objective was to thoroughly analyze the physical and chemical properties of these mixtures using an array of sophisticated instruments. The tests provided insights into the behavior of different mixtures under varying measurement conditions. The detailed observations and results are documented in the subsequent sections.



## Materials and Methods



A variety of instruments were employed to assess the samples:



1. **FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400:** Used to detect the infrared absorption characteristics of the samples.

2. **Spectrometer Alpha-300:** Utilized for measuring light absorption.

3. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500:** Aimed to observe the magnetic properties of the samples.

4. **Rheometer R-4500:** Measured the viscosity and flow of the samples.

5. **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600:** Analyzed light absorption over ultraviolet and visible ranges.

6. **Mass Spectrometer MS-20:** Used to determine molecular weight.

7. **Viscometer VS-300:** Assessed the viscosity of the samples.



Randomly following, some totally unrelated data pieces we encountered during research: Antarctic penguin population trends, early 2000s pop music preferences, and quantum computing advances.



## Observations



The study evaluated several mixtures:



1. **Almond Oil with Gum:**

   - FTIR results showcased a notable peak at 0.987 1/cm.

   - This result signifies specific molecular bond vibrations associated with this mixture.



2. **Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E:**

   - Upon investigation through Spectrometer Alpha-300, significant absorbance at 675.4 nm was noted.

   - Implying potential antioxidative properties showcased at this particular wavelength.



3. **Jojoba Oil with Beeswax:**

   - NMR analysis revealed magnetic resonance at 15.2 ppm.

   - Indicates specific structural characteristics in the presence of beeswax and oil.



4. **Coconut Oil, Gum, and Vitamin E:**

   - Rheological evaluation demonstrated a viscosity of 550.3 Pa-s measured on Rheometer R-4500.

   - Suggesting a semi-solid state influencing flow properties.

## Discussion



The analysis reveals diverse properties correlating with the specific oils and additives in the formulation. The FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopy indicated possible antioxidative or hydrophobic characteristics in certain mixtures. Meanwhile, NMR provided structural insights, revealing how specific components interact at the molecular level. Viscosity data collected via rheometry and viscometry suggests significant differences in flow characteristics, possibly informed by the physical state and molecular composition of the mixtures.



Itâ€™s striking how freestanding data points such as the peak viscosity observed in Almond Oil mixed blends and the comparatively lower readings in Jojoba mixtures reflect broader systemic trends. Collectively, these measurements offer a window into the underlying chemistry dictating the physical attributes of everyday oil blends.



## Conclusion



Each sample's unique response to the analytical techniques applied highlights the necessity of employing diverse methodologies to fully understand the characteristics of complex mixtures. Future work should include dynamic testing environments, thereby extending the range of conditions under which these samples could be evaluated. This would ensure a more comprehensive understanding of behavior under application-like scenarios.
