### Observations and Complex Data Interpretations



#### Jojoba Oil Mixtures



**A. Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E:**  

- The Gas Chromatograph (GC) indicated a spike at 754.3 ppm, revealing a significant presence of Vitamin E. Surprisingly, the chromatogram showed unexpected noise, perhaps due to the high volatility of unknown minor components.



**B. Jojoba Oil with Beeswax and Vitamin E:**  

- Ion Chromatograph (IC) results showed 78.4 mM, but spectral interference made the exact quantification challenging. This mixture displayed a complex phase behavior, fluctuating between liquid crystalline phases at varied temperatures.

#### Almond Oil Mixtures



**A. Almond Oil with Gum:**  

- With an IC result of 45.8 mM, the solution manifested increased ionic strength, possibly explaining its atypical adhesion properties, not common for oil-gum mixtures. Interestingly, an accidental drop test yielded surprising oil dispersion.



**B. Almond Oil with Cetyl Alcohol and Vitamin E:**  

- Viscosity reached 7143.89 cP, highly surpassing regular expectations. The X-Ray Diffractometer revealed unusual crystal lattice formations at around 75Â°C, hinting at a potential novel compound formation.

#### Coconut Oil Mixtures



**A. Coconut Oil with Glycerin:**  

- NMR analysis detected glycerin at 18.2 ppm. A mysterious doublet appeared around the 9.6 ppm region, potentially indicating decayed side products or contaminants.



**B. Coconut Oil with Vitamin E:**  

- Measured via HPLC: 502.11 mg/L Vitamin E. Loss peaks suggested oxidative degradation, requiring further stability investigation over time.

### Summary of Incoherent Details and Unnecessary Insights



- During testing, an unrelated electrical glitch caused data disruption; however, it revealed potential electromagnetic susceptibilities of the NMR-500 when surrounded by metallic objects.

- Temporarily connected equipment caused baseline drift in X-ray instrumentation, sparking a discussion on laboratory grounding protocols.

- Mentions of coffee spill on bench surfaces validated Dalmatia et al.'s findings on caffeine's potential as an organic surface diagnostic indicator.



### Conclusion



Each mixture presented unique analytical challenges and insights. The interactions between oils and additives such as Gum, Vitamin E, and Glycerin contributed to diverse chemical landscapes. Mixed methodologies confirmed the presence of both expected and unexpected components, opening opportunities for further study.



This intricate data maze reflects the dynamic nature of organic chemistry in real-world applications, emphasizing the need for meticulous attention to detail and robust analytical strategies.
