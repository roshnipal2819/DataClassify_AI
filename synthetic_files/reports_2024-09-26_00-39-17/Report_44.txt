### Experiment: Analysis of Various Oil Mixtures



**Report ID:** Report_44  

**Objective:** To analyze different oil mixtures using multiple techniques to determine their physical and chemical properties, which may influence their potential applications in cosmetic and food industries.



## Methodology



In this study, we evaluated various oil-based mixtures containing components such as Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, and different additives like Vitamin E, Beeswax, Cetyl Alcohol, Gum, and Glycerin. Various analytical instruments were employed to assess properties such as viscosity, absorbance, and chemical shifts. Each sample was treated as a unique mixture, even when ingredients were shared among different formulations.



### Instruments & Techniques



1. **Titrator T-905**: Used for determining Vitamin E concentration in mixtures.

2. **Microplate Reader MRX**: Measured optical density (OD), indicating interactions between components.

3. **Rheometer R-4500**: Estimated sample viscosity in Pa-s.

4. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**: Analyzed the chemical environment, reporting in ppm shifts.

5. **UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600**: Evaluated absorbance in samples, indicating compositional changes.

6. **Thermocycler TC-5000**: Determined temperature variations to assess thermal stability.

7. **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100**: Measured ionic concentration, especially for Vitamin E.

8. **PCR Machine PCR-96**: Monitored cycles (Ct) for glycerin content determination.

9. **Conductivity Meter CM-215**: Measured electrical conductivity of the mixtures.

10. **Centrifuge X100**: Applied centrifugal force at varying RPM to check phase separation potential.

11. **Viscometer VS-300**: Provided consistent viscosity measurements.

### Discussion



In analyzing these oil mixtures, several critical insights emerged:



- **Almond Oil & Vitamin E** mixtures showed significant variations in conductivity and titration values, suggesting strong ionic interactions.

- **Jojoba Oil**-based mixtures demonstrated lower viscosity values, making them suitable for applications requiring lighter formulations.

- The use of **Cetyl Alcohol** in formulations enhanced thermal stability, as evidenced by the increased melting points.

- **Glycerin**, commonly combined with gums or waxes, presented significant hydration potential as shown by its Ct values from the PCR Machine.



The study indicates varied behaviors based on component interactions, potentially guiding formulation strategies in product development.



### Conclusion



Upon utilizing diverse methodologies, the analysis confirmed that the oil-based mixtures varied distinctly across parameters like viscosity, thermal stability, and chemical interactions, aligning with their potential application scopes in industry sectors. Further investigation into specific use cases is recommended to leverage these findings effectively.
