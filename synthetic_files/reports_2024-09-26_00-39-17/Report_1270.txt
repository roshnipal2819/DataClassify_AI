## Introduction

The objective of this series of experiments was to evaluate the physicochemical properties of various oil-based mixtures under different test conditions. The primary focus was on mixtures containing Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, and Coconut Oil combined with other components such as Beeswax, Vitamin E, and Glycerin. Each mixture was subjected to multiple analytical techniques to determine diverse properties, including their mechanical, spectroscopic, and chromatographic characteristics.



## Methodology

A comprehensive series of tests were carried out using various instruments detailed below. Each instrument provided specific insights into the distinct characteristics of the sample mixtures.
