The objective of the study was to assess the chemical compositions, interactions, and properties of different oil mixtures and additives.



### Overview of Samples



The mixtures tested include:



1. **Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E**

2. **Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin**

3. **Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin**

4. **Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E**



## Methods and Instruments



The experiments involved a variety of sophisticated instruments:



- **Gas Chromatograph GC-2010**

- **Spectrometer Alpha-300**

- **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**

| Conductivity Meter CM-215   | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin         | 1500                    | uS/cm  |



### Complex Data Set:



- The **Conductivity Meter** data for mixtures containing glycerin showed increased conductivity across all measurements.



## Complex Descriptions and Detailed Results



### Rheological Properties



The rheological behavior was examined using the **Rheometer R-4500**. The viscosity of **Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E** was found to be 300 Pa-s, indicating a semi-solid consistency, ideal for cosmetic formulations. Conversely, when **Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin** was tested, the measurement showed a higher viscosity of 450 Pa-s, suggesting a more gel-like structure.



### pH Value Analysis



In experiments with the **pH Meter PH-700**, variances in acidity and alkalinity were observed. The **Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E** mixture exhibited a relatively neutral pH of 5, which is optimal for skin applications. Conversely, the **Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E** mixture was slightly more alkaline with a pH of 6.5.



### High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)



The **HPLC System HPLC-9000** provided a quantitative analysis of the **Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E** mixture, showing a concentration of 40 mg/L. For the **Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E** mixture, the concentration was markedly lower at 22 mg/L.



## Irrelevant Information



In a separate, unrelated analysis involving different equipment, a concentration of 5000 mg/L was observed, although this data does not pertain to the current set of test samples.



## Conclusion



Each mixture demonstrated unique chemical properties that are highly significant for theoretical research and practical applications. The comprehensive use of diverse analytical techniques allows us to encapsulate a broad spectrum of information regarding the formulations' characteristics.



Further studies are recommended to explore the impact of environmental conditions on these measurements. This report has consolidated the intricate results into clear, tangible insights, advancing our understanding of oil mixture behavior.



Remember: All data depicted aligns with the inherent variability typical of compound testing procedures.
