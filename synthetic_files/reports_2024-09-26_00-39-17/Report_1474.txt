## Introduction



In this study, we have analyzed various blends comprising different oils, waxes, and active ingredients, to determine their physical and chemical properties. The purpose of these experiments is to characterize the properties of mixtures containing ingredients such as **Coconut Oil**, **Jojoba Oil**, **Almond Oil**, **Beeswax**, **Cetyl Alcohol**, **Glycerin**, **Vitamin E**, and **Gum**. Various instruments were employed to obtain detailed insights into the behavior and characteristics of these mixtures.



## Methodology



Each group of ingredients was treated as a single test sample. The various analyses conducted are specified below, providing detailed descriptions of the instruments and their measured parameters.



### Instruments and Techniques
