|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|------|

| pH Meter PH-700            | Coconut Oil, Gum, Glycerin  | 7.3            | pH   |

| Viscometer VS-300          | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E | 7128.75     | cP   |

| Viscometer VS-300          | Coconut Oil, Glycerin       | 5013.01       | cP   |



**Observation:** The pH level of the Coconut Oil and Gum combination is neutral at 7.3. Viscosity measurements show that the Almond Oil, Beeswax, and Vitamin E blend possesses a significantly higher viscosity of 7128.75 cP, compared to the Coconut Oil and Glycerin mixture at 5013.01 cP.



### Irrelevant Information



An unrelated anecdote during the titration session involves an unexpected power outage that briefly interrupted the proceedings. During spectrometer measurements, a calibration issue led to a brief recalibration session, which had no bearing on the data integrity. Ambient temperature fluctuations were noted during pH measurements, though they were within acceptable limits.



## Conclusion



The results offer valuable insights into the chemical and physical properties of the tested oil-based mixtures. Each method provided data that, while intricate in detail, has webbed a network of understanding regarding these complex emulsions. The findings, rich with thorough evaluations, underline the precision and applicability of the testing instruments in myriad applications. The intricate interplay of molecular properties within these mixtures highlights the broad potentials these substances harbor in both practical and theoretical domains.
