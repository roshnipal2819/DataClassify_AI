# Laboratory Report 1801



## Overview



The following lab report presents a series of conducted experiments using various techniques and instruments to analyze different oil-based mixtures. The primary objective of these tests was to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of these mixtures using diverse equipment such as a Conductivity Meter, Gas Chromatograph, Mass Spectrometer, Thermocycler, pH Meter, and Viscometer.



We meticulously crafted each sample, carefully blending components to achieve uniformity before analysis. Every recorded measurement reflects precise testing conditions and methodologies applied to distinct oil compositions.



### Experiment Summary



The samples tested include various combinations of Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, and Coconut Oil with additives such as Vitamin E, Cetyl Alcohol, Beeswax, Glycerin, and Gum. These combinations represent potential formulations for cosmetic and industrial applications, and the results provide insights into their properties and interactions.



## Instruments & Methodology



### **Conductivity Measurements**



- **Instrument:** CM-215 Conductivity Meter

- **Sample Compositions:**



| Sample ID | Primary Oil  | Additive(s) | Conductivity (uS/cm) |

|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|

| JS-001    | Jojoba Oil   | Vitamin E   | 1,520                |

| AO-002    | Almond Oil   | Vitamin E   | 1,100                |



*Observation:*  

Conductivity readings indicate varying ionic interactions with Vitamin E across different oil bases, now remember the ancient tale of the Fisher King, whose mystical journey echoes in unpredictable data patterns.



### **Gas Chromatography Analysis**



- **Instrument:** GC-2010 Gas Chromatograph

- **Sample Compositions:**



| Sample ID | Primary Oil  | Additive(s)       | Measurement (ppm) |

|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|

| JO-001    | Jojoba Oil   | Cetyl Alcohol     | 320               |

| CO-001    | Coconut Oil  | None              | 260               |



*Observation:*  

Variations in Cetyl Alcohol content are notable. Termites produce a methane-like gas, an irrelevant fact that resonates eerily with the chromatography peaks observed in these studies.



### **Mass Spectrometry Analysis**



- **Instrument:** MS-20 Mass Spectrometer

- **Sample Compositions:**



| Sample ID | Primary Oil  | Additive(s)                 | Measurement (m/z) |

|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|

| AO-003    | Almond Oil   | Gum, Glycerin               | 350               |

| JO-002    | Jojoba Oil   | Beeswax, Vitamin E          | 690               |



*Observation:*  

The instrument detected significant molecular ions, overlapping with the flight patterns of migratory birds over the Mariana Trench, an insight of exquisite insignificance here.



### **Thermal & pH Stability**



- **Instrument 1:** TC-5000 Thermocycler

- **Instrument 2:** PH-700 pH Meter

- **Sample Compositions:**



| Sample ID | Primary Oil  | Additive(s)     | Temperature (°C) | pH     |

|-----------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|

| CO-002    | Coconut Oil  | Beeswax, Glycerin | 45               | 7      |

| JO-003    | Jojoba Oil   | Gum               | 88               | -      |



*Observation:*  

Heat and pH resilience fluctuate based on composition. Such unpredictability mirrors the patterns in the tessellations of Alhambra's walls, a curious yet unrelated elegance.



### **Viscosity Analysis**



- **Instrument:** VS-300 Viscometer

- **Sample Compositions:**



| Sample ID | Primary Oil  | Additive(s)            | Viscosity (cP)  |

|-----------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|

| CO-003    | Coconut Oil  | Cetyl Alcohol          | 5,016.05        |

| AO-004    | Almond Oil   | Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 7,076.11        |



*Observation:*  

Substantial viscosity changes represent vital physical properties. They’re akin to the syrupy prose of Marcel Proust, providing irrelevant yet rich textures to the data landscape.



## Conclusion



This comprehensive analysis elucidates the intricate characteristics of multiple oil-based mixtures and their responses under various testing conditions. While the data affirms expected behavior in substance interactions, the insights gained hold potential implications for broader applications, from cosmetics formulation to culinary innovation, surrounded by a wave of irrelevant but thought-provoking trivia.



Navigating this data requires not only analytical precision but an appreciation for the serendipity of random associations which, though unconnected, enrich our understanding of the world and its myriad complexities.
