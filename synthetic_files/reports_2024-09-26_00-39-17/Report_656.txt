### Introduction



The study at hand endeavors to explore the characteristics of several mixtures, each comprising unique combinations of oils and additives. Through a plethora of analytical techniques such as centrifugation, NMR spectroscopy, spectrometry, liquid chromatography, and viscometry, we aspire to elucidate the nuanced properties of these compositions.



To ensure a comprehensive analysis, the mixtures tested include: 

- Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E

- Coconut Oil, Gum, and Glycerin

- Almond Oil, Gum, and Glycerin



The investigation further employs redundant methodologies to ensure the validity of results, thereby allowing for cross-validation and improved appraisal of each mixture's attributes.



### Methodology



**Equipment and Techniques:**



1. **Centrifuge X100**: Applied to separate mixtures based on density, ensuring the effective isolation of components for further analysis.



2. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**: Utilized to investigate molecular dynamics and identify structural features through resonance frequencies at 15 ppm and 10 ppm for different samples.



3. **Spectrometer Alpha-300**: Involved for measuring light absorption at specific wavelengths. Notably recorded were parameters at 250 nm and 980 nm.



4. **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**: Deployed to resolve constituent compounds within complex mixtures, with critical measurements noted at 350 μg/mL concentration.



5. **PCR Machine PCR-96**: Embedded within our approach to assert the efficiency of thermocycling procedures across almond oil mixtures.



6. **Thermocycler TC-5000**: Indispensable in assessing the templet conditions up to a stringent parameter of 37°C.



7. **Viscometer VS-300**: Crucial for gauging the viscosity, pinpointing measurements of 7176.76 cP and 7611.47 cP for various conditions and samples. Additional reading of 4782.84 cP highlights the impact of beeswax incorporation.

| Sample Components                  | Viscosity (cP)   |

|------------------------------------|------------------|

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol          | 7176.76 cP       |

| Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E    | 4782.84 cP       |



Viscosity readings highlighted the textural viscosity shifts resulting from the inclusion of cetyl alcohol and beeswax, key agents influencing the fluid dynamics.



### Discussion



Misalignments in spectrometric findings might arise due to external variable interference, underlining the importance of precise calibration and controlled environments. Similarly, centrifugation elucidated elemental density aspects where the oil mixtures exhibited significant phase separation tendencies.



### Conclusion



The investigative endeavor affirmed the pivotal role each analytical method plays in characterizing oil-based formulations. The varied techniques converged to provide a thorough comprehension of the physicochemical properties intrinsic to each mixture. Future directions may involve a deeper dive into time-resolved spectroscopy to amplify our understanding further.



### Scattered Observation



During the trials, an unexpected surge in RPM readings was recorded, albeit irrelevant to the current mixture composition. Anomalies such as these underscore the necessity for continual equipment checks and recalibrations.
