# Lab Report 754: Complex Mixtures Analysis



## Introduction



In this report, we present a detailed analysis of various cosmetic formulations, focusing on their physical and chemical properties. This study evaluates mixtures prepared using different oils combined with beeswax, gum, glycerin, and/or vitamin E. Specific tests were performed using diverse instruments such as pH meters, centrifuges, ion chromatographs, X-ray diffractometers, spectrometers, and thermocyclers.



### Methodology



All tests used for each sample were conducted according to standard procedures. Measurements varied across devices, and multiple readings were taken to ensure precision and accuracy.



### Observations



1. **Mixtures Overview:**



   Each set of ingredients containing either Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, or Coconut Oil displayed distinct chemical and physical behaviors when combined with other compounds like Gum, Beeswax, Glycerin, and Vitamin E. The presence of Vitamin E often altered the reactivity and stability of the mixtures.



2. **Apparatus Specificity:**



   Different instruments provided insights into specific characteristics of each mixture, including acidity, rotational speeds under centrifugal forces, ion concentrations, crystalline structures, spectral properties, and thermal stability.
