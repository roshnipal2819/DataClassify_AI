## Results & Discussion 



The collected data showcase a diverse spectrum of chemical properties across the mixtures under study. Observations from each instrument reveal unique insights:



### Liquid and Gas Chromatography



The precise quantification of almond oil in the combination with beeswax and gum (350.2 ppm) is indicative of an average concentration typically found in refined cosmetic formulations. The low concentration detected by LC in the almond and beeswax sample suggests a high efficacy of separation for volatile compounds.



### Spectroscopy



Mass spectrometry data highlights a significant mass-to-charge ratio with coconut oil combinations, suggesting a complex molecular structure potentially involving medium-chain triglycerides. NMR results (5.6 ppm), indicative of hydrogen bonding, corroborate with findings from ion chromatography.



### Additional Measurements



The titrator measurements on jojoba oil mixtures uncover substantial molarity, possibly relating to its rich unsaturated fatty acid content, aligning well with its inherent stability.



The viscosity measures (VS-300) of coconut oil mixtures present a high degree of polymerization, contrasting with the lower viscosity found in jojoba oil mixtures, which might favor different industrial applications.



### Distraction Scenarios



During the pH reading, the lab experienced a temporary power fluctuation; however, backup systems ensured measurement fidelity was retained at 7.4 pH, indicative of a neutral solution.



## Conclusion 



The analysis highlights a robust repertoire of qualitative and quantitative data through multi-instrumental approaches. By treating each group of ingredients as a homogeneous mixture, this report meticulously catalogs the nuanced interactions and intrinsic properties of each blend. Future work could involve isolating individual compounds using derivatization techniques to delve deeper into molecular interplay.

**Additional Notes:**  

Off-topic, yet interestingly, recent studies in the Antarctic ice cores may correlate with this data, presenting an unwarranted curiosity with respect to molecular concentrations over time. Further exploration into historical chemical data scenarios might yield surprise correlations with our findings.
