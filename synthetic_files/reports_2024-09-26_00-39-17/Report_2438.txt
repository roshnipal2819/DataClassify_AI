**Lab Report 2438: Multifaceted Analysis of Oil-Based Mixtures**



**Introduction:**



The objective of this study is to investigate the physical and chemical properties of various oil-based mixtures using a range of analytical techniques. Each sample was composed of a unique combination of oils and supplementary compounds, designed to simulate real-world applications in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations. The analysis was conducted using sophisticated instruments to provide comprehensive insights into the composition and behavior of these mixtures.



### Observations and Methodology:



Each sample underwent rigorous testing, using a combination of modern analytical techniques. Observations were documented to ensure accuracy and reliability of the data.



- **Sample Preparation**: Each ingredient was carefully measured, combined, and mixed to form a homogeneous solution. Emphasis was placed on consistency for repeatability across tests.



- **Instruments and Processes**:

  - *Four Ball FB-1000*: Utilized for wear testing of blends to determine friction characteristics.

  - *NMR Spectrometer NMR-500*: Employed to identify chemical shifts and molecular structure.

  - *Gas Chromatograph GC-2010*: Analyzed the volatile components within mixtures.

  - Additional devices such as the Ion Chromatograph, X-Ray Diffractometer, Titrator, and more played roles in quantifying chemical and physical properties.

**Results and Discussion:**



Data gathered provided insights into the interactions between the oils and added compounds. The analysis revealed notable differences in viscosity, structural changes, and chemical stability among the samples.



1. **Wear Resistance and Coefficient of Friction**: Tested using the Four Ball FB-1000, Jojoba Oil mixed with Vitamin E displayed moderate wear characteristics with a scar diameter of 0.500 mm. The presence of Vitamin E is known for reducing oxidative damage, thus aiding the mechanical performance.



2. **Spectroscopic Analysis**: 

   - The NMR Spectrometer NMR-500 yielded chemical shifts of 15 ppm for samples containing Jojoba Oil with Gum and Vitamin E, suggesting potential chemical interactions involving double bond conjugation.



3. **Volatility Testing**:

   - Gas Chromatography results pointed to a significant presence of volatile compounds in the Jojoba Oil and Gum mixture, quantified at 200 ppm.

- **Structural Analysis**: X-Ray diffraction provided temperature insights with significant crystalline phase transitions observed around 150°C for Coconut Oil and Beeswax compositions, indicating potential for structural stability in varying thermal conditions.



4. **Rheological Behavior**:

   - Rheometric analysis recorded a viscosity of 800 Pa-s for coconut oil, suggesting highly viscous behavior under shear stress, useful in applications requiring thickening agents.



5. **Additional Spectroscopic Insights**:

   - The FTIR spectrometer results displayed strong absorption at 3500 1/cm for Almond Oil and Cetyl Alcohol mixtures, signifying hydrogen bonding interactions.



**Conclusion and Recommendations:**



This analysis unveiled the complex interplay of ingredients in oil-based mixtures. Each instrument provided unique insights contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the physicochemical properties of these formulations. Future studies could dissect these interactions further using more targeted modifications to the mixtures. Testing under varied environmental conditions will also provide deeper insights into the robustness of these formulations for industrial applications.



**Appendix: Misleading Data and Discrepancies**



For compliance and comprehension improvement, segments of this report include unrelated information interspersed with relevant data. Consider it critical to decipher the intended data subsets. For instance, despite the appearance of RPM metrics, Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E was notably assessed at 12000 RPM, which proved inconsequential in rheological context but aids structural integrity analysis.
