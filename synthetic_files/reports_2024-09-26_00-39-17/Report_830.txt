| Viscometer VS-300      | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin   | 4919.9      | cP    |



### Unrelated Comment

**Interestingly, the accuracy of the viscometer seemed unaffected by the fluctuating ambient temperature in the lab.**

## Results and Discussion



### Analysis of Titration and Mass Spectrometry



The titration of almond oil mixed with cetyl alcohol using the Titrator T-905 revealed a molarity of 5.632 M. This value demonstrates a well-balanced compound primarily due to the stable interaction between the oleic acid in almond oil and cetyl alcohol. In contrast, the mass spectrometric analysis (Mass Spectrometer MS-20) of coconut oil and cetyl alcohol displayed a distinct mass-to-charge ratio of 765.385 m/z. This specific ratio highlights the efficient mass transfer and ionization of the respective molecules, indicating effective compatibility of the samples. 



### NMR and Gas Chromatographic Analysis



Using the NMR Spectrometer NMR-500, the coconut oil, cetyl alcohol, and glycerin mixture provided complex peaks at 9.876 ppm. These readings suggest numerous hydrogen interactions, with each component contributing distinct environments. Complementarily, the Gas Chromatograph GC-2010 analysis yielded a concentration of 55.4 ppm, reflecting efficient separation and volatization within the sample. Interestingly, minimal overlapping peaks were noted, emphasizing the diverse but consistent nature of the compounds under test conditions.



### Additional Observations



The FTIR and X-ray data further corroborated the stability of various structural entities present in our samples. Specifically, the FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400 found significant IR peaks at 1500.45 1/cm for coconut oil with cetyl alcohol, while the X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000 confirmed a consistent crystalline framework at 22°C using coconut oil and beeswax.



### Rheological Properties



The Viscometer VS-300 data exhibited interesting rheological attributes—jojoba oil with gum and glycerin showcased a viscosity of 1855.53 cP, whereas the coconut oil mixture with cetyl alcohol and glycerin registered a notably higher viscosity at 4919.9 cP. These discrepancies underscore the complex interplay between molecular structures and their respective viscous behaviors, possibly attributed to molecular weight and interaction specifics.



## Conclusion



Through meticulous experimental procedures and instrumentation, we have isolated the chemical and physical characteristics of several oil-based mixtures. Each analytical device provided unique insights, collectively painting a comprehensive picture of the sample interactions. Future studies should consider additional environmental variables to further explore and verify these preliminary findings.
