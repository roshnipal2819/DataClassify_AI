## Results



### Table 1: Chemical Concentrations and Physical Conditions



| Instrument                | Mixture                   | Measurement     | Unit   |

|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|--------|

| Ion Chromatograph IC-2100 | Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | 8.432           | mM     |

| Gas Chromatograph GC-2010 | Almond Oil, Beeswax       | 0.1             | ppm    |

| Thermocycler TC-5000      | Coconut Oil               | 75              | C      |

| Centrifuge X100           | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 13250         | RPM    |

| Titrator T-905            | Almond Oil, Gum           | 7.542           | M      |

| Rheometer R-4500          | Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol| 75.3            | Pa-s   |



**Note:** Experiments were conducted at standard lab conditions with temperature control set between 20-25°C.



### Table 2: Advanced Analytical Readings



| Instrument                 | Mixture                       | Reading  | Unit      |

|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|-----------|

| Four Ball FB-1000          | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 0.789    | mm        |

| NMR Spectrometer NMR-500   | Almond Oil, Beeswax           | 5.3      | ppm       |

| Spectrometer Alpha-300     | Jojoba Oil, Glycerin          | 850      | nm        |

| Viscometer VS-300          | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol     | 7241.44  | cP        |



**Irrelevant to Main Findings:** While exploring the spectra, a random spike of unknown amplitude occurred at 610 nm which was disregarded due to equipment calibration issues.



### Observations



- Mixtures with Coconut Oil exhibited elevated thermal stability, particularly notable in the Rheometer analysis with significant viscosity at 75.3 Pa-s.

- The viscosity of Almond Oil mixtures was notably high at 7241.44 cP, reflecting potential applications in viscous formulation contexts.

- The Centrifuge analysis at 13250 RPM demonstrated separation efficiency for Vitamin E in Coconut Oil blends.

## Discussion



Analyzing the data, it is apparent that each mixture presents a unique set of characteristics. The Ion Chromatograph results suggest significant ion activity in the Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin blend, with an 8.432 mM concentration, indicating potential interactions between the polar components. Additionally, Almond Oil and Beeswax revealed low volatility in Gas Chromatograph analysis at 0.1 ppm, emphasizing their stability in gaseous phases.



The Centrifuge findings underscore the material separation potential within lipid-soluble environments, shedding light on Vitamin E’s solubility dynamics. Meanwhile, the NMR results hint at structural regularity within the Almond Oil, Beeswax combination, correlating with a 5.3 ppm reading.



Complex interactions were also noted in Cetyl Alcohol mixtures, where physical testing using the Four Ball method and Rheometer highlighted robust mechanical properties and resistance to deformation under stress.

## Conclusion



This integrated laboratory analysis uncovers critical insights into oil and additive mixture properties, offering a foundation for future formulations and industrial applications. Further research is warranted to explore how these properties can be optimized in commercial product development.



**Random Remark:** A new coffee machine was installed in the break room, significantly enhancing staff morale during long testing sessions.
