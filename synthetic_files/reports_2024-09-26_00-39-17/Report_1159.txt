# Laboratory Report 1159



## Introduction



This report presents the findings of various tests performed using a range of scientific instruments. Each test focuses on different mixtures of ingredients, testing specific properties and characteristics. The instruments used included a pH Meter, Liquid Chromatograph, Titrator, Ion Chromatograph, PCR Machine, NMR Spectrometer, Centrifuge, FTIR Spectrometer, Microplate Reader, Rheometer, and Viscometer. The samples consisted of complex mixtures such as Coconut Oil combined with Glycerin, Almond Oil with Beeswax, among others.



## Tests and Measurements



### pH Analysis



Our analysis began with the pH measurement of Coconut Oil combined with Glycerin. Utilizing the **pH Meter PH-700**, we observed a pH level of 7.2, indicating neutrality. This assessment is crucial to understanding the intermolecular interactions within this oil-glycerin system.



### Chromatographic Assessments



Further examining the substances' composition, the **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400** was used. In analyzing the Coconut Oil and Beeswax mixture, we found detectable materials at a concentration of 150.3 micrograms per milliliter (ug/mL). This suggests a significant level of active compounds.



### Titration Results



Using a **Titrator T-905**, we focused on Almond Oil combined with Glycerin. A precise molarity of 0.35 M was recorded, indicative of specific ionic interactions that may influence the mixture's chemical stability.



### Ion Concentration



The **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100** revealed an ion concentration of 5.6 mM in the Almond Oil sample. This quantification is essential for tracing ionic compounds and understanding their role in various applications.



### Genetic Amplification Data



In a completely unrelated procedure, the **PCR Machine PCR-96** determined a Ct value of 22 for a Jojoba Oil and Cetyl Alcohol mixture. Although more relevant for nucleic acid amplification, this test confirms procedural accuracy.



### Spectroscopic Insights



The **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500** findings for Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin showed chemical shifts observed at 12.5 parts per million (ppm). This value, critical in assessing molecular dynamics, supports the array of complex interactions present in this three-component system.



### Physical Observations



- The **Centrifuge X100** was employed to spin a mixture of Jojoba Oil, Gum, and Glycerin at a robust speed of 7500 RPM. This centrifugal force aids in sedimentation studies by promoting phase separation, revealing texture and body characteristics of emulsions.

  

- **FTIR Spectrometry** indicated an absorbance peak at 850 cm^-1 for the Coconut Oil and Glycerin sample. This refers to specific vibrational frequencies and is significant for functional group analysis.



### Optical Density Measurement



When reviewing the Coconut Oil with Beeswax, our **Microplate Reader MRX** recorded an Optical Density (OD) of 2.6. This measurement can potentially relate to impurity content.



### Rheological Properties



A **Rheometer R-4500** was used on an Almond Oil and Glycerin combination to obtain a viscosity of 420 Pascal-seconds (Pa-s), affirming this solution's non-Newtonian flow behavior.



### Viscosity Analysis



#### Table 1: Viscosity Considerations



| Sample Composition                                | Instrument      | Viscosity (cP) |

|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E             | Viscometer VS-300 | 5042.67        |

| Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin                     | Viscometer VS-300 | 7261.2         |

| Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E                    | Viscometer VS-300 | 3130.39        |



For various mixtures, the apparent viscosity displayed a hierarchy, with Almond Oil mixtures reaching higher viscosities. This raises implications about molecular entanglements and density factors, influencing formulation stability.



## Discussion



These complex investigations expose critical correlations between different measurement techniques and the inherent physical, chemical, and biological properties of the samples under consideration. Irrelevant procedural variability underscores our ongoing need for methodical integrity, albeit resulting in indirect but intriguing overlaps such as Ct values in emulsions â€” a humorous but irrelevant digression from expected standard assays.



The findings are encoded within layers of multifaceted descriptors and may require further deconstruction for complete apprehension. Longitudinal studies are recommended for deeper insights into the evolution of these properties over extended periods, considering environmental influences.
