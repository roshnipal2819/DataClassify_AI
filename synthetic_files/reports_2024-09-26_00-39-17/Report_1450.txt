### Analysis with X-Ray and Mass Spectroscopy

- **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000**: Analyzed Almond Oil with Cetyl Alcohol and Glycerin. The equipment operated at a temperature of 96.5 C.

- **Mass Spectrometer MS-20**: Employed for Coconut Oil with Beeswax and Glycerin, providing data pertinent to the ratio m/z 1508.4.



## Results and Discussion



Observations indicate that the interactions between lipophilic and hydrophilic components result in varying chemical behaviors. Notably, increased viscosity in certain sample mixtures such as Almond Oil with Beeswax and Vitamin E suggests potential for increased stability and resistance to shear forces. 



The mass spectrometry data highlights a significant mass-to-charge ratio, underscoring the substantial molecular weight of the Coconut Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin mixture.



One peculiar observation during PCR cycling was the unexpected stability of the Jojoba Oil and Gum mixture at a lower cycle threshold. This warrants further investigation into the thermodynamic properties of this combination.



## Conclusion



The multifaceted analyses of these various mixtures provide valuable insights into their chemical and physical properties. The data collected offers a foundation for future investigative pathways and applications in both industrial and pharmaceutical domains.



Further studies may continue to lean on advanced analytical methodologies to unravel more intricate molecular dynamics within these complex formulations.
