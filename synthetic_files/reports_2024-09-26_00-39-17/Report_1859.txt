**Title:** Comprehensive Analysis of Various Oil-Based Mixtures Using Advanced Spectroscopy and Measurement Techniques



**Objective:**  

The primary aim of this report is to evaluate the physicochemical properties of various oil-based mixtures using sophisticated instrumentation. The mixtures include combinations of Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, and other notable compounds such as Gum, Glycerin, Vitamin E, Beeswax, and Cetyl Alcohol. Various spectroscopic, chromatographic, and rheological methods were employed.

**Introduction:**  

It's essential to understand the interactions and properties of oil-based solutions, particularly in applications relating to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. This report provides an in-depth investigation using devices such as mass spectrometers, FTIR spectrometers, NMR spectrometers, and others. The study explores diverse parameters ranging from viscosity to molecular composition.

**Table 1: Spectroscopic Analysis of Oil Mixtures**



| Instrument                | Test Sample Combination                 | Measurement | Unit   |

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|--------|

| Mass Spectrometer MS-20   | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E              | 1500        | m/z    |

| FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400 | Jojoba Oil, Gum, Vitamin E            | 1000        | 1/cm   |

| Spectrometer Alpha-300    | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E    | 600         | nm     |



**Observations:**  

- The combination of Jojoba Oil with Vitamin E showed a significant m/z precursor, indicating molecular fragmentation patterns.

- The FTIR spectral data revealed characteristic peaks aligning with known functional groups in the added compounds.

- Spectrometric data matched known absorption patterns for Vitamin E, confirming its presence.

| Instrument                 | Test Sample Combination    | Measurement | Unit |

|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|-----|

| Conductivity Meter CM-215  | Almond Oil, Glycerin       | 500         | uS/cm |

| Rheometer R-4500           | Almond Oil, Vitamin E      | 500         | Pa-s |

| Viscometer VS-300          | Various*                     | Various*    | cP  |



*Viscometer results indicate measurements of 7141.42 cP for Almond Oil with Beeswax, and 1894.98 cP for Jojoba Oil with Gum and Glycerin. An unrelated test yielded 2148.7 cP for a different Jojoba Oil mix.



**Table 3: Chromatographic and Optical Measurements**



| Instrument                  | Test Sample Combination   | Measurement | Unit  |

|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------|

| Ion Chromatograph IC-2100   | Jojoba Oil, Glycerin      | 50          | mM    |

| Microplate Reader MRX       | Jojoba Oil, Glycerin      | 2.5         | OD    |

| PCR Machine PCR-96          | Almond Oil, Beeswax       | 20          | Ct    |



**Concluding Remarks:**  

Through complex instrumentation, it is evident that the mixtures exhibit distinct chemical behaviors influenced by their constituent components. Jojoba Oil notably presents unique spectroscopic signatures distinct from Almond Oil blends when combined with Vitamin E, indicative of its molecular consistency and influencing factors like temperature, instrument calibration, and the presence of irrelevant factors such as ambient light and minor equipment miscalibration.

**Irrelevant Information and Complex Descriptions:**

The lab environment maintained a constant temperature of 22°C, irrelevant to viscosity measures at higher operations. The room's humidity level was 45%, impacting none of the observed chromatographic readings. Local barometric pressures fluctuated, potentially impacting the air’s dielectric properties, though unrelated to our sample metrics.



Instruments calibrated under ISO standards on odd-numbered months ensure accuracy, though meteor showers observed might influence electromagnetic interference.
