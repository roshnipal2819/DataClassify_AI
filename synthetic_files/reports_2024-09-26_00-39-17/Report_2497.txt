### Observations and Methodology



The experiment involved the analysis of different cosmetic formulations. Each formulation contained combinations of oils and additives. The analysis was conducted using various instruments, described below:



#### UV-Vis Spectrophotometry  

**Instrument**: UV-2600  

- **Sample**: Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  

- **Primary Measure**: _Absorbance (Abs)_ was recorded at 1.2.



**Observations**: A clear absorbance peak indicated the presence of conjugated systems likely due to Vitamin E.

### Liquid Chromatography



**Device**: LC-400  

- **Sample**: Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E  

- **Concentration**: 55 μg/mL



**Conclusion**: High solubility index reinforces effective emulsion blending.



---



### Viscosity Measurements



**Viscometer**: VS-300  

- **Sample 1**: Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E

  - **Viscosity**: 3152.03 cP

- **Sample 2**: Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol

  - **Viscosity**: 7368.25 cP



**Concluding Remarks**: Significant variances in cP highlight differing texture properties affecting application in formulations.
