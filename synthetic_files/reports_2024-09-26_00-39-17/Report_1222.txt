# Laboratory Report 1222



## Introduction



This report provides a comprehensive analysis of various mixtures using advanced equipment. Each test sample, consisting of unique mixtures such as Jojoba Oil with additives, was subjected to a series of experiments to evaluate physical and chemical properties. The aim was to determine parameters such as conductivity, light absorption, centrifugation speed, and viscosity.



## Equipment and Methodology



A wide range of sophisticated equipment was employed, including but not limited to the Titrator T-905, Centrifuge X100, and Spectrometer Alpha-300. The tests focused on determining concentrations, rotation speeds, wavelengths, and viscosities. Measurements were conducted with precision instruments ensuring high fidelity of the data acquired.



### Observations



1. **Sample A:** Comprised of Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin, this test sample displayed specific variability in conductivity and complex interaction with light, as measured by both titration and spectrometry.

2. **Sample B:** Integrating Coconut Oil with Beeswax, this sample demonstrated high stability when subjected to centrifugal forces and showed remarkable peaks in infrared spectrometry.

3. **Sample C:** Incorporating Coconut Oil and Glycerin, the sample demonstrated distinct changes upon X-ray exposure, indicating structural characteristics which suggest potential relationships with crystallization behaviors.
