## Introduction



In this experimental analysis, we explored multiple oil mixtures using state-of-the-art equipment. These mixtures included combinations such as Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, and Almond Oil with additives like Vitamin E, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin. Each mixture was tested for its properties using a select group of instruments, each designed to measure specific parameters.

## Materials and Methods



A variety of apparatus and techniques were employed:



- **Four Ball Wear Tester (FB-1000)**

- **Spectrometer (Alpha-300)**

- **X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD-6000)**

- **HPLC System (HPLC-9000)**

- **pH Meter (PH-700)**

- **PCR Machine (PCR-96)**

- **Centrifuge (X100)**

- **Conductivity Meter (CM-215)**

- **Liquid Chromatograph (LC-400)**

- **Viscometer (VS-300)**



These instruments were crucial in capturing data across a broad range of properties: abrasiveness, spectral absorption, crystalline structure, component concentration, pH balance, amplification cycle threshold, centrifugal force tolerance, electrical conductivity, liquid chromatography, and viscosity.

## Results and Discussion



The experiment yielded valuable insights into the properties of various oil-based mixtures:

- **Wear Resistance:** Jojoba Oil demonstrated moderate wear resistance at 0.512 mm, suggesting moderate durability in physical applications.

- **Spectral Characteristics:** Coconut Oil with Vitamin E and Gum absorbed light at 450 nm, illustrating distinct absorption peaks relevant for UV protection.

- **Thermal Stability:** Almond Oil with Beeswax sustained crystalline structure up to 120 °C.



High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated Jojoba Oils' active compound presence at 250 mg/L, essential for cosmetic formulation. Meanwhile, pH levels and conductivity were found to be optimal, influencing mixture stability and electrical properties.
