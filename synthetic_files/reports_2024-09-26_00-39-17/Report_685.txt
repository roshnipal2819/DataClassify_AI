## Experimental Observations



### Mixture Analysis



#### Jojoba Oil and Glycerin

1. **Four Ball Wear Test:**  

   A series of trials recorded an average wear scar diameter of 0.450 mm. The material's surface exhibited a standard pattern of lubricity similar to synthetic esters.



2. **Conductivity:**  

   Measurements revealed a conductivity of 1200 uS/cm, presenting moderate ionic dispersibility, potentially enhancing formulation stability when emulsified.



#### Coconut Oil and Cetyl Alcohol

1. **X-Ray Diffraction:**  

   The scattering intensity peaked at 90Â°C, indicating crystalline structural changes likely due to thermal influence on the medium-chain triglycerides.



2. **Mass Spectrometry:**  

   Spectral analysis showed a prominent signal at 800 m/z, corresponding to molecular fragmentation indicative of cetyl alcohol presence.



#### Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E

1. **Centrifugation**  

   Spun at 12000 RPM, the mixture showed excellent phase separation and density stratification, potentially useful for targeted delivery systems.



2. **pH Measurements**  

   Recorded at 7.8 pH, this mixture exhibits neutrality suitable for cosmetic applications, maintaining epidermal compatibility.



#### Miscellaneous Trials



| Instrument            | Mixture               | Observation                  |

|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|

| PCR Machine PCR-96    | Jojoba Oil/Cetyl/Vitamin E | 28 Ct (Cycle threshold) detection, comparable with lipid metabolism markers |

| Titrator (T-905)      | Jojoba Oil/Beeswax    | Acid number calculated at 0.008 M, indicating low free fatty acids         |

| UV-Vis Spectrophotometer | Coconut Oil/Beeswax | Absorbance peak at 2.1 Abs, highlighting potential as UV screen material   |

| FTIR                 | Jojoba Oil/Cetyl/Vitamin E | Peak absorption at 1500 1/cm, affirming carbonyl bond stretches             |



#### Viscosity Studies



Table of Viscosity Measurements:



| Mixture                          | Viscosity (cP) |

|----------------------------------|----------------|

| Coconut Oil                      | 4843.67        |

| Coconut Oil/Beeswax/Vitamin E    | 4976.48        |

| Almond Oil/Gum/Glycerin          | 7744.64        |



All viscosities were determined with a VS-300 Viscometer, showing viscosity enhancements in complex mixtures, likely due to increased molecular interactions and structural alignment of components.



## Results and Discussion

### Complex Mixture Dynamics

The results illuminate a synergistic interaction between the base oils and various additives, modulating both physical and chemical properties conducive to targeted applications. Mixtures showed variable conductivities and viscosities, correlating with potential uses in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.



### Structural and Chemical Attributes

Both XRD and FTIR spectroscopies demonstrated distinctive changes attributable to temperature effects and molecular bonding dynamics, underscoring the utility of these mixtures in responsive formulations.



### Conclusion

Each test sample exhibited unique characteristics dependent on its components, providing a detailed profile of potential applications and interactions. Further refinement in separation and detection methods can elucidate long-term stability and broader functional potentials.



Irrelevant detail and unexpected outcomes were noted, such as color changes during centrifugation, meriting exploration in the pursuit of application in aesthetic consumer products.
