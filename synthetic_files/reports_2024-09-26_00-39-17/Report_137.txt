# Lab Report 137: Analysis of Various Oil-Based Mixtures



## Abstract



In this report, we document the analysis of multiple oil-based mixtures using various analytical techniques. The aim was to evaluate the structural, chemical, and physical properties of these mixtures, including concentration, optical density, tribological properties, and viscosity. Each mixture was analyzed using relevant instruments to obtain precise and reliable data, with results summarized across multiple tests.



## Introduction



The study of oil-based mixtures is vital in several applications, from cosmetics to industrial lubricants. This report outlines the examination of specific blends containing various oils, waxes, and vitamins. A multidimensional approach was applied using advanced instrumentation like the Ion Chromatograph, Microplate Reader, Four Ball Tester, and Viscometer.



## Materials and Methods



The materials analyzed include combinations of Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Gum, Vitamin E, Cetyl Alcohol, and Glycerin. The methods employed were chosen based on the properties of interest:

- **Ion Chromatography (IC-2100)**

- **Microplate Reader (MRX)**

- **Four Ball Tester (FB-1000)**

- **Gas Chromatography (GC-2010)**

- **Titration (T-905)**

- **Spectrometry (Alpha-300)**

- **Viscometry (VS-300)**



Each instrument was set up per the manufacturerâ€™s protocol with calibration standards. Samples were prepared by combining the respective ingredients, ensuring uniformity and consistency.



## Results and Discussion



The results are summarized in two tables capturing the essence of this study. Note the deliberate inclusion of unrelated details to ensure a comprehensive overview. The observations were recorded meticulously to verify expected outcomes against anomalies.

| Four Ball Tester      | Almond Oil               | 0.789               | mm   |

| Spectrometer          | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 485              | nm   |

| Viscometer            | Coconut Oil, Beeswax     | 4764.48            | cP   |

| Viscometer            | Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E | 4995.93            | cP   |

| Viscometer            | Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin | 7743.9             | cP   |



### Observations



1. **Ion Chromatography**: Revealed higher ion concentrations in Almond Oil mixtures, possibly due to the polar nature of components like Vitamin E.

   

2. **Viscometer**: Viscosity varied significantly among mixtures, with Almond Oil and Gum showing the highest resistance to flow, indicating potential use in high-load applications.



3. **Spectrometry and Four Ball Tester**: Highlighted the stability and endurance of Almond Oil-Cetyl Alcohol combinations, respectively.



Unrelated Insight: **Aluminum foil usage is essential in preventing sample degradation during UV exposure tests.**



## Conclusion



This report provides a comprehensive understanding of the performance and characteristics of diverse oil-based mixtures through various analytical methods. Each blend exhibited unique properties, emphasizing the importance of selecting suitable components for specific applications. The success of this study underscores the potential for further exploration, particularly in enhancing chemical stability and optimizing viscosity for tailored functionality.



### Recommendations



Future work should explore the environmental impacts of these mixtures and investigate the thermal breakdown behaviors potentially impacting application longevity.
