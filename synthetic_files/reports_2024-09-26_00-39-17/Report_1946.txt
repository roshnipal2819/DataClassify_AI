## Experimental Data and Results:



### Table 1: X-Ray Diffraction Analysis



| Sample | Temperature (Â°C) |

|--------|------------------|

| Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin | 75 |

| Coconut Oil, Glycerin         | 160 |



*Observation*: The mixture with Coconut Oil exhibits a higher crystalline transition temperature, indicating greater thermal stability compared to Almond Oil-based mixtures.



### Table 2: Titration Results



| Sample                          | Molarity (M) |

|---------------------------------|--------------|

| Coconut Oil, Gum, Vitamin E     | 5.4          |

| Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin   | 0.6          |



*Note*: Higher molarity in Sample B suggests a greater concentration of titratable species, possibly due to the presence of reactive gum components.



### NMR Spectroscopy:



For the mixtures analyzed via the NMR Spectrometer NMR-500, chemical shifts were observed at:



- **Sample B**: 14.7 ppm

- **Sample C**: 18 ppm



*Conclusion*: The observed shifts indicate variations in chemical environments between the mixtures, reflecting differences in the bonding of Vitamin E within the mixture matrices.



### Table 3: Chromatographic Analysis



| Sample | Concentration (ug/mL or mg/L) |

|--------|-------------------------------|

| Coconut Oil, Glycerin | 300.5 ug/mL|

| Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E | 420.3 ug/mL|

| Coconut Oil, Vitamin E | 450 mg/L|



*Remark*: The concentration differences highlight the diversity in functional components, with Sample E showing a notably high concentration, indicative of concentrated active components.



### UV-Vis Spectroscopy Absorbance:



- **Sample A**: 2.8 Abs



*Insight*: Absorbance measurement implies moderate optical density, characteristic of Beeswax presence.



### Viscosity Measurement



- **Sample F**: Almond Oil, Vitamin E results in high viscosity of 7556.52 cP, suggesting a thick consistency due to the lack of other thinning agents like Glycerin.



## Conclusion



The investigation of multiple oil-based mixtures revealed significant variation in both chemical and physical properties, dependent on the specific constituents. Analytical methodologies, including titration, spectroscopy, chromatography, and viscometry, provided a comprehensive understanding of each mixture's unique properties. These results highlight the importance of ingredient composition in tailoring specific mixture characteristics. Further exploration into scalability and application of these findings in industrial settings is recommended to enhance the efficacy of oil-based products.
