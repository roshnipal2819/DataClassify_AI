# Laboratory Report 1810



## Introduction



This report presents the results of a comprehensive analysis conducted on various mixtures using advanced laboratory equipment. The focus was to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of different oils combined with specific additives. The tools employed include the Ion Chromatograph IC-2100, pH Meter PH-700, X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000, Microplate Reader MRX, PCR Machine PCR-96, and Viscometer VS-300. These instruments provided detailed insights into the concentration, pH, structural, and viscosity properties, among others.

## Materials and Methods



### Instruments and Samples

Various mixtures of oils and other compounds were analyzed. The mixtures were prepared using almond oil, coconut oil, and jojoba oil as the primary components. The additives included cetyl alcohol, vitamin E, beeswax, gum, glycerin, among others. 



### Methodology

The methodologies used are aligned with standard laboratory practices for each instrument. For example, the Ion Chromatograph measured ionic concentrations in mM, the pH meter assessed the acidity or alkalinity, while the X-Ray Diffractometer and PCR Machine provided structural and amplification data, respectively.

## Complex Observations and Descriptions



The interaction between almond oil combined with cetyl alcohol and vitamin E demonstrated a moderate ionic strength of 5.234 mM, as revealed by the Ion Chromatograph. When beeswax was introduced to almond oil and glycerin, a significantly higher concentration of 8.965 mM was noted, suggesting enhanced interactions or breakdown.



The pH Meter PH-700 results revealed coconut oil with cetyl alcohol exhibited a slightly acidic pH value of 6.75, whereas the almond oil blend with cetyl alcohol showed a lower pH of 5.8, indicating potential differences in acid-base balance or buffer capacity within these mixtures.



X-Ray Diffractometer data illustrated a variation in the structural conformation with two distinct temperature readings (25.4 °C and 30.2 °C), elucidating the thermal behavior changes due to glycerin presence.



Microplate Reader MRX results highlighted the increased turbidity perhaps due to the emulsifying action of gum and glycerin, as evidenced by OD values of 1.25 and 2.1.



PCR Machine readings (Cycle Threshold) at 12 and 15 respectively, suggested differential amplification capabilities, which may correlate with the nucleotide stability facilitated by glycerin additives within the coconut oil matrix.



Viscometer findings confirmed significant divergence in viscosity. Almond oil mixed with glycerin had a viscosity of 7523.88 cP, compared to 1989.52 cP in jojoba oil mixed with gum. These variances could suggest differing molecular interactions and chain entanglements.

## Conclusion



The findings from this suite of tests underscore the complexities inherent in oil-component interactions. Each measurement and method provided unique insights, making it possible to profile, compare, and understand the behavior and properties of these oil-based mixtures. The data collectively contribute to future optimization in product formulation. 



Irrelevant artifacts were deliberately omitted, ensuring the focus remained tightly controlled, veracious, and aligned with testing objectives as inconsistencies would have hindered the reliability of the observed outcomes.
