**Laboratory Report: Complex Mixture Analysis - Report_1962**



---



### Introduction



The following report details the extensive analysis of various cosmetic ingredient mixtures using a range of advanced laboratory instruments. The aim is to characterize the rheological, chemical, and physical properties of different formulations containing combinations of Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E, Gum, and Glycerin. Data has been compiled from multiple independent analyses, ensuring robust and comprehensive insights into each mixture.

### Instrumentation and Methodology



A diverse set of instruments was used to assess the properties of the mixtures, each targeting specific characteristics:



1. **Rheometer R-4500**

2. **NMR Spectrometer NMR-500**

3. **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**

4. **Centrifuge X100**

5. **PCR Machine PCR-96**

6. **Thermocycler TC-5000**

7. **pH Meter PH-700**

8. **Spectrometer Alpha-300**

9. **Viscometer VS-300**



Each mixture was evaluated for viscosity, chemical composition, concentration, separation behavior, thermal stability, acidity, and light absorption.

### Results



#### Rheological Properties



| Mixture | Instrument | Measurement | Observation |

|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | Rheometer R-4500 | 520 Pa-s | Thick, homogeneous mixture with excellent shear properties. |

| Almond Oil | Viscometer VS-300 | 7602.97 cP | High viscosity observed, indicative of a dense fluid. |

| Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol | Viscometer VS-300 | 7371.2 cP | Slightly lower viscosity due to presence of alcohol which acts as a thinning agent. |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol | Viscometer VS-300 | 5292.91 cP | Moderate viscosity, suitable for lightweight applications. |



#### Chemical Composition



| Mixture | Instrument | Measurement | Observation |

|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|

| Almond Oil, Glycerin | NMR Spectrometer NMR-500 | 12 ppm | Clear peaks observed; no impurities detected. |

| Jojoba Oil, Gum | Centrifuge X100 | 13000 RPM | Complete separation achieved, indicative of phase immiscibility. |

| Coconut Oil | PCR Machine PCR-96 | 30 Ct | Amplification confirmed; presence of structurally intact substances. |



#### Concentration and Spectral Analysis



| Mixture | Instrument | Measurement | Observation |

|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol | Liquid Chromatograph LC-400 | 250 µg/mL | Concentration suitable for intended use. |

| Almond Oil, Glycerin | Spectrometer Alpha-300 | 450 nm | Strong absorption band, related to glycerin’s intrinsic properties. |



#### Thermal and Acidity Analysis



| Mixture | Instrument | Measurement | Observation |

|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|

| Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | Thermocycler TC-5000 | 65°C | Stable under thermal cycling, suggests resilience against temperature fluctuations. |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | pH Meter PH-700 | 7.5 pH | Neutral pH, ideal for skin application. |



### Observations



- Among the tests performed, Jojoba Oil mixtures demonstrated significant stability and consistent rheological properties.

- Coconut Oil’s neutral pH profile aligns with its application in gentle skin-care products.

- Observed spectral data demonstrated resonance patterns correlating with expected molecular configurations for components used.

- Viscosity studies revealed that adding Cetyl Alcohol to mixtures generally decreases viscosity compared to pure bases.



### Conclusion



The comprehensive data collected throughout various tests indicate that all evaluated mixtures exhibit desirable properties for potential cosmetic and therapeutic products. Each combination's unique profile offers a different balance of benefits. Adjustments in component ratios further tailor these characteristics to specific applications.



Future studies should focus on long-term stability testing and skin compatibility assessments to ensure product efficacy and safety upon commercialization.
