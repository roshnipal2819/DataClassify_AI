## Equipment and Methods



1. **Ion Chromatograph IC-2100**: Utilized to analyze ionic content in emulsions.

2. **Four Ball FB-1000**: Conducted tribological testing to assess wear resistance.

3. **PCR Machine PCR-96**: Applied for differential analysis based on cycle threshold.

4. **X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000**: Employed for structural analysis at high temperatures.

5. **Rheometer R-4500**: Measured the viscous behavior of oil-based samples.

6. **Spectrometer Alpha-300**: Determined the optical activity of the mixtures.

7. **Liquid Chromatograph LC-400**: Quantified specific compounds in the samples.

8. **Viscometer VS-300**: Assessed viscosity variations among different blends.



### Test Mixtures

- **Sample A**: Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin

- **Sample B**: Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E

- **Sample C**: Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol

- **Sample D**: Almond Oil

- **Sample E**: Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E

- **Sample F**: Coconut Oil

- **Sample G**: Coconut Oil, Beeswax

- **Sample H**: Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin



## Observations



During testing, it was observed that:

- **Sample A** exhibited a minor turbidity, likely due to the presence of Beeswax.

- **Sample B** had a slightly increased viscosity, potentially from the addition of Cetyl Alcohol.

- Notable aggregation was seen in **Sample C**, attributed to interactions between Almond Oil and Cetyl Alcohol.

- **Sample D** appeared stable at higher temperatures as assessed using XRD-6000.

- **Sample E** showed non-Newtonian fluid behaviorâ€”shear-thinning properties were particularly noticeable.
