**Lab Report: Analysis of Cosmetic Ingredients (Report_320)**



**Objective:**

This report aims to present the analysis of various cosmetic ingredient mixtures using different analytical instruments. The components include oils, alcohols, waxes, and vitamins. Each mixture is treated as a single test sample, analyzed for specific properties.



---



**Abstract:**



In this study, complex mixtures involving Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Beeswax, Glycerin, and Vitamin E were analyzed using diverse techniques. The primary goal was to quantify the presence of each component and assess physical and chemical properties under different conditions.

**Experimental Section:**



**Sample Preparation:**

The combinations of ingredients were accurately weighed and prepared under controlled temperature (23Â°C) and humidity (45%) conditions to maintain consistency. The mixtures were then divided and analyzed as follows:



**1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**



*Instrument:* Mass Spectrometer MS-20  

*Sample:* Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E  

*Observations:* Notable ion fragmentations.  

*Results:*



| m/z Ratio | 1450 |

|-----------|------|



*Complex Description:* The detected ion peaks strongly suggested the presence of cetyl alcohol molecules interacting with unsaturated portions of coconut oil.

**2. Chromatographic Analysis:**



*a) Liquid Chromatography:*



*Instrument:* Liquid Chromatograph LC-400  

*Sample:* Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin  

| Compound Concentration (ug/mL) | 250 |

|----------------------------------|------|



*b) Ion Chromatography:*



*Instrument:* Ion Chromatograph IC-2100  

*Sample:* Jojoba Oil  

*Concentration:* 15 mM  



*Irrelevant Information: The instrument was calibrated using a standard solution containing an undisclosed proprietary compound unrelated to current objectives.*



**3. Gas Chromatographic Analysis:**



*Instrument:* Gas Chromatograph GC-2010  

*Sample:* Coconut Oil  

| Results (ppm) | 700 |

|---------------|-----|



*Complex Description:* The thermal stability of the sample was in congruence with expected alkane behavior.



---



**4. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis:**



*Instrument:* HPLC System HPLC-9000  

*Sample:* Coconut Oil, Glycerin  

*Observations:* Peak elution time suggested a synergy between compounds.  

| Concentration (mg/L) | 150 |

|----------------------|-----|



---



**5. Spectroscopy and Rheological Analysis:**



*a) UV-Vis Spectroscopy:*



*Instrument:* UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600  

*Sample:* Almond Oil, Beeswax  

*Absorbance:* 2.5  



*Description: Irrelevant spectral data included an unexplained secondary peak at 600 nm unrelated to the sample matrix.*



*b) Rheometry:*



*Instrument:* Rheometer R-4500  

*Sample:* Coconut Oil  

| Viscosity (Pa-s) | 300 |

|------------------|-----|



*c) Viscosity Test:*



*Instrument:* Viscometer VS-300



| Sample Composition  | Viscosity (cP) |

|---------------------|----------------|

| Almond Oil, Beeswax | 7106.45        |

| Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin | 5054.78 |
