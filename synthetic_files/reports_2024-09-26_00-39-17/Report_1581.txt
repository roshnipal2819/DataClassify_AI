### Discussion



The combination of methods allowed for a rich dataset—a snapshot of complex interactions among various oils, gums, alcohols, and additives. Notably, the **high centrifugal force** utilized in the analysis of the Coconut Oil and Beeswax mixture isolated denser phases at **14500 RPM**; meanwhile, mass spectrometry outlined a characteristic mass-to-charge ratio at **789.6 m/z** for the Coconut Oil, potentially identifying unforeseen compounds.



X-Ray Diffraction testing at **125.0°C** suggested stable lattice formations, leading to the presumption of glycosidic linkages in the Coconut Oil, Gum, and Glycerin mix. Titration of the Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E mixture found an exceedingly low molarity at **0.005 M**, underscoring potential for high antioxidant capacity.
