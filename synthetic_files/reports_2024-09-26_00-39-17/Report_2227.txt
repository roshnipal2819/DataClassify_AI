#### Detailed Descriptions



##### Section A: Chromatographic Analysis



The **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)** results revealed that the **Jojoba Oil and Gum** mixture (375 mg/L) presented a consistent peak resolution along with reproducible behavior throughout the trials. Conversely, **Coconut Oil, Vitamin E** showed high variability with potential secondary interactions affecting peak reproducibility, notably at 500 mg/L.



**Liquid Chromatography** experiments, particularly with **Almond Oil and Gum**, displayed stability in thermal analysis with a marked variance noted near 75°C, hinting at possible phase transition tendencies.

##### Section B: Mass Spectroscopic and Ultraviolet Analysis



The **Mass Spectrometer MS-20** effectively fragmented the **Coconut Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E** mixture at 950 m/z, corroborating our hypotheses regarding the molecular weight distributions in this tri-component system.



Ultraviolet analysis via **Spectrometer Alpha-300** on **Almond Oil** and **Vitamin E** revealed a significant absorption peak at 650 nm, suggesting intense electronic transitions within the blend.

**Note:** Variations in viscosity observed while testing **Coconut Oil** using a **Viscometer VS-300** registered at 4866.65 cP, although devoid of accompanying agents, delineate a highly non-Newtonian fluidic nature largely characteristic of such lipidic substances.
