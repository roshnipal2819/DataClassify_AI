### Viscosity and Wear Resistance



#### Rheometer



The study of the viscosity involved the usage of the Rheometer R-4500. Notably, samples displaying higher viscosity often demonstrated superior stability under mechanical stress.



- **Observations for Jojoba Oil, Beeswax**: Measurement indicated a substantial viscosity of 11.6 Pa-s. The dense structure posits limited motion under applied force, signifying a more consistent composite.



- **Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E**: At 5.0 Pa-s, this mixture remained moderately mobile, showing reduced resistance which correlates with effective application under mild friction conditions.



#### Four Ball Test



Wear resistance further substantiated the sample's application durability. Coconut Oil had a wear scar diameter of 0.350 mm, depicting minimal wear. Meanwhile, Jojoba Oil, Beeswax exhibited a marginally larger scar, measured at 0.500 mm, suggesting slightly higher wear rates under identical conditions.

#### Titration Outcomes



In the titration experiments administered through the Titrator T-905, different mixtures showed considerable variations in molarity:



- Jojoba Oil, Gum, Glycerin demonstrated a molarity of 0.010 M, hinting towards higher reactive compound presence.  

- Contrastingly, Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin exhibited a lower molarity of 0.005 M.

## Conclusion



The comprehensive analysis conducted through multifarious equipment unveiled notable differences across the tested samples about their physical attributes and chemical compositions. Each group's stability, wear resistance, viscosity, and molecular arrangements were intricately documented, illustrating the diverse characteristics imparted by the unique compositions. These studies serve as a foundational database for optimizing formulations and enhancing product attributes.



**Unexpected elements noted:** A small yet considerable variation in sample behavior indicated potential ramifications from unforeseen interferences during experimentation, meriting further investigation.



**Note:** Any conclusions or applicability must be corroborated with future experimental validations and cross-reference with additional control groups.
