**Report ID:** Report_1901   

**Date:** Department of Chemical Analysis   



**Objective:**  

The primary objective of this laboratory exercise was to evaluate the chemical properties of various oil-based mixtures using advanced analytical techniques. Each mixture was tested for different parameters using the following instruments: Ion Chromatograph, Centrifuge, X-Ray Diffractometer, Spectrometer, Mass Spectrometer, and Viscometer. The analysis focused on samples including combinations of Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Gum, Vitamin E, and others.

#### Results  



The data gathered from the experimentation presented various insights into the physical and chemical properties of the mixtures.



- **Ion Chromatograph Results (Table 1):**

  | Sample Composition         | Ionic Concentration (mM) |

  |----------------------------|--------------------------|

  | Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E | 54.328                   |

  | Almond Oil, Glycerin       | 23.845                   |



In the tables above, deviations in mM readings presented a significant correlation to the mixture's ionic constituents.



- **Centrifuge Test Results (Table 2):**

  | Sample Composition | RPM     |

  |--------------------|---------|

  | Coconut Oil, Beeswax| 12500  |

  | Almond Oil         | 11000   |



Inconsistencies in RPM could suggest variation in density and phase separation efficiencies.

### Discussion  



The analysis reveals critical insights into the characterization of composite mixtures. The presence of Vitamin E consistently manifested in the data through shifts in ionic concentration, spectral absorption, and mass spectrometric analysis, suggesting its prominence in these formulations. Discrepancies observed across the spectrometer's different readings might be attributed to variability in mixture homogeneity.



Spectroscopy and chromatography results align, providing substantial evidence of the impact each component has on the overall physicochemical profile of the mixtures. The precision in viscosity measurements reinforces the influence of combined thickening agents, like gums, within these compositions. Additionally, patterns in diffraction intensity provide a deeper understanding of molecular arrangements and structural properties.



### Conclusion  



The comprehensive analysis elucidates the integral role of individual components in defining the overall properties of complex mixtures. There is a noteworthy interaction between the constituents, heavily influencing the analytical output across diverse testing methods. Further studies might explore the scalability of these findings within industrial applications.



*This report concludes the testing for Report ID 1901, though additional testing may be warranted for further verification.*
