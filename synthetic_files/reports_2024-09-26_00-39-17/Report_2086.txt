### Observations



The diverse mixtures assessed in this study illustrated a wide range of physical and chemical behaviors as indicated by the measurement results. For instance, the viscosity of the oils combined with varied waxes demonstrated significant variability, hinting at complex interactions at the molecular level.



The analysis using FTIR spectroscopy identified characteristic absorption bands associated with different functional groups which were prominent in the Almond Oil, Beeswax, and Glycerin mixture. The HPLC analysis confirmed the concentration of Vitamin E in the Jojoba Oil and Gum mixture with high precision.



Random observations revealed that the NMR spectroscopy provided unique insights into the molecular environment when Coconut Oil was combined with Gum and Vitamin E, showing intriguing shifts in chemical shifts.
