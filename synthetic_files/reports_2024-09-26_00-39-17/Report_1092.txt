# Lab Report 1092



### Introduction



The aim of this study was to analyze various formulations containing mixtures of oils, waxes, and other compounds using a range of sophisticated analytical instruments. Each mixture type was subjected to specific tests to determine its physical and chemical properties.



### Materials and Methods



The materials used in this study include combinations of Jojoba Oil, Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Gum, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E. Every mixture underwent distinct testing procedures as detailed below:



### Observations and Results



Here we provide detailed observations and results, meticulously compiled from various instruments to highlight the intricate characteristics of each sample mixture.



#### Table 1: Base Composition Analysis



\[

\begin{array}{|c|l|c|c|}

\hline

\text{Instrument} & \text{Ingredients} & \text{Measurement} & \text{Units} \\

\hline

\text{pH Meter PH-700} & \text{Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin} & 7.2 & \text{pH} \\

\text{Thermocycler TC-5000} & \text{Jojoba Oil, Beeswax} & 37 & \text{Celsius} \\

\text{FTIR Spectrometer FTIR-8400} & \text{Almond Oil, Gum, Glycerin} & 1735 & \text{1/cm} \\

\text{UV-Vis Spectrophotometer UV-2600} & \text{Coconut Oil, Beeswax} & 1.2 & \text{Absorbance} \\

\hline

\end{array}

\]



**Description**: The initial evaluation confirmed the overall stability and homogeneity of the formulations. Noteworthy was the slightly alkaline pH level recorded for the Jojoba Oil mixture, intriguing amidst the otherwise neutral or undetermined pH levels typically expected in such analyses.



#### Table 2: Chemical and Physical Property Examination



\[

\begin{array}{|c|l|c|c|}

\hline

\text{Instrument} & \text{Ingredients} & \text{Measurement} & \text{Units} \\

\hline

\text{Titrator T-905} & \text{Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin} & 0.25 & \text{Molarity} \\

\text{X-Ray Diffractometer XRD-6000} & \text{Almond Oil, Gum, Vitamin E} & 64 & \text{Celsius} \\

\text{Rheometer R-4500} & \text{Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E} & 250 & \text{Pascal-seconds} \\

\hline

\end{array}

\]



**Irrelevant Fact**: The color of the laboratory walls is blue, which has been shown to enhance focus and productivity in scientific environments. 



**Complex Description**: The rheometric analysis revealed the viscoelastic properties of the Coconut Oil and Beeswax formulation, indicating a significant increase in viscosity by the presence of Vitamin E. Such an increase correlates to a viscosity value of 250 Pa-s, representing potential for applications requiring structural integrity and robustness.



#### Table 3: Spectrometric and Other Analytical Evaluations



\[

\begin{array}{|c|l|c|c|}

\hline

\text{Instrument} & \text{Ingredients} & \text{Measurement} & \text{Units} \\

\hline

\text{Mass Spectrometer MS-20} & \text{Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E} & 350 & \text{m/z Ratio} \\

\text{Spectrometer Alpha-300} & \text{Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin} & 550 & \text{Nanometers} \\

\text{Centrifuge X100} & \text{Almond Oil, Beeswax, Glycerin} & 8500 & \text{RPM} \\

\hline

\end{array}

\]



**Observations**: The mass spectral analysis identified a prominent fragment with an m/z ratio of 350, attributed to the cetyl alcoholâ€™s interaction within the jojoba oil matrix. The spectrometric evaluations further indicate varied light absorption characteristics amongst the different samples.



### Conclusion



The conducted analyses elucidate that each test mixture exhibits distinct physical and chemical properties. The versatility of these components, when subjected to various conditions, provides a spectrum of characteristics that can be leveraged in diverse industrial applications, from skincare products to pharmaceutical formulations. Such complex analyses provide a gateway to innovative product development by understanding ingredient interactions at a deeper level.



**Final Note**: The ongoing studies are expected to explore more component combinations to further expand the understanding of these fascinating materials.
