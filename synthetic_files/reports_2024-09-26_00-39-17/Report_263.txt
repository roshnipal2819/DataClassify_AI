### Discussion



The oil-based mixtures tested exhibited varying properties based on their composition. For instance, the measurement using the Four Ball Tester showed that the Coconut Oil mixture provided better wear resistance (0.680 mm) compared to its Almond Oil counterpart (0.450 mm). 



Meanwhile, FTIR analysis suggested significant molecular differences between almond oil-based mixtures, indicated by absorption peaks at 1234 1/cm and 1987 1/cm. The presence of Beeswax appears to influence the spectral characteristics substantially. The UV-Vis analysis reinforced these findings with notable absorbance peaks when different combinations were exposed to ultraviolet-visible light.



Conductivity measurements, particularly in the presence of additives such as Gum and Vitamin E with Coconut Oil, reached up to 350 uS/cm, indicating a reasonably conductive mixture. Notably, viscosity measurements varied across almond oil mixtures, highlighting the significant impact of additional components like Cetyl Alcohol and Vitamin E on fluid resistanceâ€”ranging from 7266.2 cP to 7693.62 cP.



### Conclusions



This intricate analysis reveals the importance of component interactions within oil-based mixtures and their resultant properties. The data garnered from different analytical instruments provide a multi-faceted view of how oils and additives behave under mechanical, spectral, and fluid dynamic conditions. Further research should focus on exploring additional combinations and environments to better understand these interactions.
