## Detailed Analysis



The complexity of combinations within the substances tested provides insights into their interactions at the molecular level. The **HPLC-9000** reports notable quantifications, particularly in **Jojoba Oil**, with a strikingly high concentration of 900 mg/L compared to its Almond counterpart. The presence of **Glycerin** in the **NMR Spectrometer** analysis suggests notable spectral shifts, indicating interactions not readily apparent in primary tests.



Particularly compelling are the **pH measurements** obtained via the **PH-700** on the Coconut-based mixtures, showing variability that may imply an impact from oxidative stability and emulsifying components such as **Gum**.



Unexpected complexities arose in viscosity readings with the **Viscometer VS-300**, where stark differences in the presence of **Beeswax** illustrate its viscosity-enhancing effect, recorded prominently in coconut oil-based formulations at 4703.74 cP.

## Conclusions



Through meticulous assessment and discernment of each testing phase, significant information regarding the structural and compositional integrity of oil mixtures has been deduced. Results render vital insights that can be instrumental in determining the suitability of these formulations for prospective applications such as cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations.



Additional investigations are requisitional to further decode the underlying mechanisms at play, particularly concerning variations observed in molecular interactions as revealed by nuances in the acquired data. This actionable intelligence contributes to an enhanced comprehension of these complex systems, inviting further exploration.
