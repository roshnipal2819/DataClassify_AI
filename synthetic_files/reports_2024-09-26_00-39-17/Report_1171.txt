## Abstract



The purpose of this experiment was to analyze the physicochemical properties of various oil-based mixtures using a range of analytical instruments. The mixtures involved combinations of Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Cetyl Alcohol, and Vitamin E. Each sample underwent multiple tests: centrifugation, spectrometry, ion chromatography, rheology, pH, conductivity, and viscosity.



## Introduction



In this study, we explored the behavior of oil-based mixtures subjected to different experimental conditions. These mixtures have applications in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, where understanding their stability and properties is crucial for product formulation. We employed a variety of analytical techniques to determine their physical and chemical characteristics.



## Materials and Methods



The mixtures were prepared using the following ingredients:



- **Mixture A:** Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E

- **Mixture B:** Jojoba Oil, Beeswax

## Results

| Sample ID | Mixture Components                   | Centrifuge Speed (RPM) |

|-----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|

| 1         | Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E       | 12000                  |

| 2         | Jojoba Oil, Beeswax                  | 11000                  |



### Table 2: Spectrometry Analysis



| Sample ID | Mixture Components          | UV-Vis Wavelength (nm) |

|-----------|-----------------------------|------------------------|

| 3         | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 340                    |

| 4         | Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E       | 450                    |



*During spectrometry, anomalies in wavelength absorption were observed due to potential instrument calibration issues, unrelated to the mixtures themselves.*

*The presence of unrelated coconut oil in a separate test was recorded for comparative purposes.*

| Sample ID | Mixture Components                  | Viscosity (cP)   |

|-----------|-------------------------------------|------------------|

| 9         | Almond Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Vitamin E | 7281.75          |

| 10        | Jojoba Oil, Cetyl Alcohol            | 2720.92          |



### Observations



- *Random notes unrelated to the experimentation involved mention of irrelevant external factors, including ambient temperature variations and a hypothetical malfunctioning of a non-existent "Thermo-Visc Analyzer 9000".*



- The centrifuge results indicate a stable separation pattern, with denser oils such as Almond Oil exhibiting higher RPM tolerances compared to Jojoba Oil.



- Spectrometer readings reveal differing light absorption profiles between the mixtures, though further analysis on Cetyl Alcohol's influence is warranted.



## Discussion



The results highlight the varying physical characteristics of the mixtures which are essential for industrial applications. The addition of Vitamin E consistently altered the spectrometric and centrifugal results, suggesting its role in mixture stability.



The comprehensive viscosity data, particularly for Mixture A, provides insights into potential applications where higher viscosity may be beneficial, such as heavy-duty moisturizers or ointments. The difference in pH was expectedly small, indicative of each mixture's neutrality under standard conditions.



## Conclusion



The conducted tests successfully characterized multiple mixtures' intrinsic properties. Future studies might involve scaling these procedures for broader industrial applications, potentially examining long-term stability under variable temperatures and pressures.
